        "MLLM_answer": "- First image: Propaganda poster featuring a soldier holding a flag.\n- Second image: Display of ancient artifacts, including stone tools and carvings.\n- Relation: Historical context.\n- Explanation: The first image is a propaganda poster that likely dates back to a specific historical period, possibly related to military or political events. The second image shows ancient artifacts, which provide insight into early human history and cultural development. Both images are connected through their historical context, as they represent different eras and aspects of human history.",

            "score_reason": "The MLLM's output captures a broad concept of 'historical context,' which is partially related, as both images indeed reflect history. However, it fails to accurately connect the specific historical context of the Cultural Revolution and lacks critical details regarding the ideological campaigns and cultural destruction that characterize the period.

The common theme connecting these two images is the concept of \"time is money,\" suggesting that time is a valuable resource, much like money.",

Both the explanation and reasoning align well with the standard answer, indicating that the hourglass represents time and the coins represent wealth, emphasizing the value of time as comparable to money."

The first image shows ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics, which were used as a writing system in ancient Egypt. The second image is an old celestial map, which was used for navigation and understanding the night sky. Both artifacts are valuable sources of information about the cultures and societies that created them.",

However, the response fails to connect the images specifically to 'Maya Stelae' as indicated in the standard answer. The explanation given by the MLLM does not include relevant facts about the Maya's use of hieroglyphs and astronomical charts, missing the cultural specificity and richness found in the standard answer."

While this view might be seen as correct on a superficial level, it misses the specific idiomatic or cultural reference explained in the standard answer.

Both images are connected through the theme of creativity and imagination, with the first image being a product of creative expression and the second image representing the process of generating new ideas.",

The first image shows a tiger, often associated with strength and power, walking majestically through a forest, which can be seen as its natural kingdom. The second image features a small dog dressed in royal attire, sitting on a throne, directly symbolizing royalty. The connection lies in the portrayal of these animals as rulers or kings in their respective environments.",

            "score_4o": "2",
            "score_reason": "The MLLM's output focuses on 'Animals in regal settings' emphasizing the perceived nobility of both animals. However, it does not connect this notion with the idea from the standard answer that the absence of a dominant force (the tiger) allows a lesser authority (the dog) to reign. The explanation does not incorporate the contrast between the tiger's true power and the dog's temporary rule, making it broader than the specific insight provided by the standard answer."

Both scenarios involve searching for something valuable, whether it's food for survival or wealth for enrichment.",

Although this concept of 'revealing value' could be broadly related to the standard answer's explanation of 'revealing insights under adversity,' the response does not specifically reflect the metaphorical proverb used in the standard answer. The MLLM's explanation does not align with the intended reasoning behind the proverb 'ঘোড়া ডুবলে খুরা বুঝা যায়,' which is about discovering true qualities in adversity."

Lentils, shown in the second image, are a common ingredient in many dishes and can be part of a balanced diet. Both images relate to food sources, one being animal-based (chicken) and the other plant-based (lentils).",

The second image represents condensation, where water vapor in the air cools and turns back into liquid, forming clouds over the ocean. This connection highlights the continuous movement of water on Earth, known as the water cycle.",

However, it doesn't align with the specific proverb theme 'बूंद बूंद से सागर भरता है' emphasized in the standard answer. The explanation about transpiration and condensation connects to the water cycle but lacks the metaphorical aspect of small actions leading to a greater outcome as intended in the standard answer."

The second image depicts a statue of Lord Ganesha, indicating the worship and reverence for this deity during the same festival. The connection between the two images lies in their association with the celebration of Ganesh Chaturthi, where modaks are offered as prasad (sacred food) and Lord Ganesha is worshipped.",

It accurately connects modaks and Lord Ganesha to the celebration of Ganesh Chaturthi. The explanation provided aligns with the standard answer by associating modaks with the offerings made during the festival and the statue of Ganesha with the deity worshipped during the celebration.

The explanation asserts that the two images do not have a common theme or connection, overlooking the cultural aspect of the idiom. It broadly connects the camel and chia seeds but fails to delve into the symbolic interpretation present in the standard answer. Although it doesn't directly contradict the standard reasoning, it doesn't align with it either, scoring a 2 for a broad but not entirely relevant explanation."

The first image shows two dancers executing a ballet routine with precision and elegance, while the second image captures the natural flow of a winding mountain road through a scenic landscape.
