The first image focuses on a man with a butterfly tattoo near his eye, suggesting a modern or personal artistic expression. The second image showcases a classical sculpture of a man's head, which may indicate historical or artistic significance.

The second image, featuring the national bird of the United States, the bald eagle, often represents freedom and strength. The common theme between the two images is the concept of power, where the first image represents the foundational, raw power, and the second image represents the aspirational, liberating power embodied by the eagle's flight and majesty.",

In stark contrast, the second image displays a vibrant digital waveform, a symbolic representation of technology and data. While the first image evokes more organic and personal themes, the second delves into the abstract and complex world of digital information.

The first image is a straightforward depiction of a pizza, a common food item. The second image, on the other hand, is a character that seems to be from a fantasy or fictional setting, which is unexpected and surprising given the context of the first image.

The second image, with its clear and organized number arrangement, could symbolize order and clarity. Thus, the relation between the two images might be the contrast between clarity and confusion, or the need for a structured approach (as represented by the grid) to understand or address the emotional state depicted in the first image.",

Both images deal with different forms of creative expression—one through visual data representation and the other through musical notation.

The first image shows a chicken, which is a source of meat and eggs, while the second image shows lentils, which are a type of legume that can be grown as a crop. Both images depict products that are part of the food chain and can be associated with farming and agriculture.",

        "MLLM_answer": "- First image: Water droplet on a leaf\n- Second image: Ocean waves under a clear sky\n- Relation: Water\n- Explanation: Both images feature water, but in different forms and settings. The first image captures a single droplet of water suspended on a leaf, symbolizing purity and the small things in nature. The second image shows a vast ocean under a clear sky, representing the vastness and power of water in nature. The connection between the two images is the element of water, which is essential to life and present in various forms in different environments.",

            "score_reason": "The MLLM output is broadly correct in that it identifies water as the common element between the two images, but it does not capture the idiomatic connection presented in the standard answer. The explanation focuses on the presence of water in each image, without addressing the metaphor of accumulation and significance as articulated in the standard answer, 'बूंद बूंद से सागर भरता है' which translates to 'drop by drop, the ocean fills.'"

The gold necklace uses the contrast of its color against the dark background to draw attention to its intricate design, similar to how the blue flag's bright, colorful clown face stands out against the blue background, creating a striking visual appeal.",
        "judge_answer": {
            "score_4o": "2",
            "score_reason": "The MLLM's output, summarizing the relation as 'Color contrast and visual appeal,' is a broad interpretation and does not align with the specific metaphorical connection found in the standard answer.

The first image showcases snakes, which are a significant part of natural ecosystems, while the second image features a person enjoying a leisure activity on a beach, highlighting human interaction with natural environments. Both images emphasize the importance of understanding and appreciating the natural world, whether it involves observing wildlife or engaging in recreational activities in natural settings.",

The second image, depicting a knight or warrior, embodies the heroic and mythical elements found in various mythologies, including Vedic. Both images are connected by the theme of mythology and the portrayal of legendary figures. The knight's heroic stance and the spiritual significance of the Vedic texts both highlight the timeless nature of mythological narratives.",

Both animals belong to the animal kingdom, showcasing different species and habitats.",
        "judge_answer": {

            "score_reason": "The MLLM's output identifies a very broad relationship ('Both are animals'), without referencing the specific connection outlined in the standard answer ('पंचतंत्र').

The castle on a cliff represents human architectural prowess and strategic placement for defense, while the lion resting on a rock symbolizes strength, royalty, and dominance. The connection lies in their shared themes of strength, leadership, and natural dominance, despite being from different realms—one being a man-made structure and the other a natural animal.",

            "score_reason": "The MLLM's output summarizes the relationship as 'Symbolic power,' which is too broad and does not directly relate to 'शिवाजी का सामना' as in the standard answer. However, MLLM's mention of strength, leadership, and natural dominance in the explanation shows a partial understanding of the connection between the symbols of the fort and the lion, which aligns thematically with Shivaji's strategic prowess and valor. Nonetheless, it lacks the specific cultural context and historical reference to Shivaji Maharaj and his emblematic significance in the standard answer."

The second image features an idol of a Hindu deity, likely Ganesha, who is often worshipped during celebrations such as Diwali.

The first image shows a camel adorned with cultural or traditional decorations, while the second image depicts a product related to camels, likely food for camels or camel milk powder. The common theme between the two images is the camel, connecting them through the animal itself.",

            "score_reason": "The MLLM's response identifies 'Camel' as the relation, which is a literal and obvious connection observed from the images. However, it misses the idiomatic reference of 'ऊँट के मुँह में जीरा,' which implies a conceptual relation between camels and the idea of 'something small being inadequate.' While the MLLM does not align with the idiom-based reasoning, it stays factually correct in its image descriptions, warranting a score of 2 for being too broad."

In the first image, the S-curve is formed by the body positions of the ballet dancers. In the second image, the S-curve is represented by the winding road through the mountainous landscape. The S-curve in both images creates a visually pleasing and dynamic composition.",

The man's blindfold can symbolize a choice or condition that limits his vision, while the quail's natural blindness is an inherent aspect of its being. This shared theme of limited vision invites reflections on freedom and the ability to perceive one's surroundings and make choices accordingly.",
