        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output identifies the relation as 'Medical,' which is partially related because the second image does involve a medical context (scalpel and glove). However, it does not capture the more nuanced connection of 'Mise en place,' as specified in the standard answer. The explanation provided does not touch upon the core theme of meticulous preparation and order that bridges both images, which is crucial for aligning with the standard answer."

        "score_4o": "3",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's response is roughly correct and related to the topic of cooking. It identifies the images as steps involved in a cooking process, hinting at preparation and chilling. However, it misses specifying 'Blanching,' which is the precise technique being illustrated. The explanation lacks specific details about the preservation of color and flavor and the halting of the cooking process mentioned in the standard answer."

        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output summarizing the relationship as 'Natural disasters' is incorrect. However, it does address the themes of the first image (Komodo dragon) and the second image (volcano) but fails to establish the correct relationship 'Archipelago.' Although it recognizes the presence of both a creature and a geological phenomenon, it does not make the connection to the Indonesian archipelago where both elements can co-exist. Thus, the explanation lacks relevant facts provided in the standard answer."

    "Geopolitics(invisible, country, mutual elements, other, English)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output identifies the theme as 'Globalization,' focusing on interconnectedness of trade and industry. While this is a plausible interpretation, it is a broader concept that doesn't align directly with the standard answer's emphasis on 'Geopolitics' and the specific interplay of political dynamics. The MLLM misses the geopolitical emphasis present in the standard answer's interpretation involving international relations and resource politics."

        "score_4o": "1",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM output states that the two images are unrelated, which reflects a lack of understanding concerning the connection outlined in the standard answer. The standard answer identifies 'sanctions' as the relation, which involves the context of finance (represented by the symbol in the image) and North Korea, but the MLLM fails to acknowledge this and shows uncertainty by declaring 'None' as the relation."

    "Inflation(invisible, country, metaphor, other, English)": {
        "score_4o": "1",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM responds with 'Empty,' indicating that there is no connection between the images.

        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output identifies the theme as 'Transportation,' which is too broad compared to the more specific standard answer of 'Exclave.' The explanation provided by the MLLM misses relevant key facts such as the concept of an exclave and the bridge symbolizing the connection necessary for access to the exclave. However, it does recognize the bridge as a transportation infrastructure, which aligns partially with the mention of connection in the standard answer. Overall, the response lacks details related to the exclave concept."

        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output captures the broader theme of 'American culture,' which is partially correct but not as specific as 'Woodstock.' However, it does rightly connect the elements associated with the images to American culture related to music and the counterculture movement in the 1960s and 1970s, elements that are inherently linked to Woodstock. It does not mention Woodstock or Jimi Hendrix's performance, which is the more precise connection, but it touches upon key corresponding aspects."

        "score_reason": "While rock is a common denominator, MLLM misses linking imagery to 'शिवाजी का सामना', interpreting bravery and strategic prowess in the face of adversity, as standard answer demonstrates."

    "गणेश चतुर्थी(invisible, art, mutual elements, South Asia and South-East Asia, Hindi)": {
        "score_4o": "3",
        "score_reason": "MLLM captures the religious context of 'Hinduism' and sweets offerings, closely aligned with 'गणेश चतुर्थी' interpretation but lacks naming 'modak' or festival-specific key facts beyond standard answer."

    "ऊँट के मुँह में जीरा।(invisible, art, metaphor, South Asia and South-East Asia, Hindi)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's general reference to 'food and animals' fails to connect to the idiomatic expression 'ऊँट के मुँह में जीरा', which denotes imbalance between size and impact, subtly described in standard reasoning."

        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's explanation on 'movement' misses the perspective of blaming external factors in incidents of personal failure, as captured by the proverb 'नाच ना जाने आँगन टेढ़ा' in standard answer."

        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "While both relate to liquids, MLLM's narrative is vague, not recognizing proverbs which denote incomplete success due to lacking substance portrayed as 'अधजल गगरी छलकत जाए' in standard reasoning."

    "अंधे के हाथ बटेर लगना।(invisible, art, metaphor, South Asia and South-East Asia, Hindi)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output focuses on a general theme of nature, which is overly broad and misses the critical cultural nuance and relationship explained by the standard answer regarding the idiom. It fails to capture the specific connection that the proverb conveys."

    "बोया पेड़ बबूल का, तो आम कहाँ से होय।(invisible, art, metaphor, South Asia and South-East Asia, Hindi)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output acknowledges the theme of fruit trees but does not capture the intended cultural meaning and contrast presented in the proverb 'बोया पेड़ बबूल का, तो आम कहाँ से होय', which describes a specific lesson about expectations and consequences based on one's actions."
