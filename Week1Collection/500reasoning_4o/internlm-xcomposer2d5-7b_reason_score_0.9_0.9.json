This machine is used to create detailed images of the inside of the human body, which can be used to diagnose and monitor various medical conditions.\nSecond image: The second image is a diagram illustrating magnetic field lines. It shows the direction and strength of the magnetic field around a bar magnet, with arrows indicating the direction of the magnetic field lines and shaded areas representing the strength of the magnetic field.\nRelation: The relation between the two images can be described as the application of magnetic fields in medical imaging. The MRI scanner in the first image uses a strong magnetic field, similar to the one illustrated in the second image, to create detailed images of the body's internal structures.\nExplanation: MRI scanners like the Toshiba Vantage Titan 3T rely on powerful magnetic fields to align the nuclei in a person's body. When radio waves are then applied, they cause the nuclei to release energy as they return to their original alignment. This energy is detected by the scanner and used to create detailed images of the body. The diagram of magnetic field lines in the second image provides a visual representation of how magnetic fields work, which is fundamental to understanding the operation of MRI scanners.",
