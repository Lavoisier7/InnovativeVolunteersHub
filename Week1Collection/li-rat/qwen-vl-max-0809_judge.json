Although it correctly describes the images separately, it doesn't identify the indirect relation based on their similar shapes, as highlighted in the standard answer, which explains the relationship through the shared concept of a 'cane.'"

While this assertion of contrast is factual, it doesn't capture the specific connection described in the standard answer related to 'onion.' Additionally, the MLLM fails to reference any relevant facts concerning the shape similarities that form the basis of the standard answer."
