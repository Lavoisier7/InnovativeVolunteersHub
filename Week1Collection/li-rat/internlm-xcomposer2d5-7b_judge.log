{
    "score_4o": "2",
    "score_reason": "The MLLM's output summarizes the relationship as 'outdoor elements,' which is too broad and not related to the standard answer 'pizza.' The explanation does not address the intended reasoning related to the round shape of the wheel resembling a pizza or the fireplace's connection to an oven used for cooking pizza."

Folder: crosswalk(invisible, location, mutual elements, NA, English)
{
    "score_4o": "2",
    "score_reason": "The MLLM output suggests a broader concept of contrast between nature and human-made structures, failing to pinpoint the specific connection highlighted in the standard answer, which relates to the visual similarity between a zebra's stripes and the lines of a crosswalk. It does not mention the relationship between the images and a crosswalk, a key fact in the standard answer."

Folder: cane(invisible, stuff, mutual elements, NA, English)
{
    "score_4o": "2",
    "score_reason": "The MLLM summarizes the relationship as 'Mobility' and uses the cucumber to symbolize growth and flexibility, while the wheelchair is seen as a device aiding mobility. Although this notion of mobility is somewhat relevant, the explanation lacks direct connection or facts related to the concept of a 'cane' as per the standard answer."

Folder: onion(invisible, food, mutual elements, NA, English)
{
    "score_4o": "2",
    "score_reason": "The MLLM's output interprets the images as a 'Contrast' between the spiritual and the mundane, which is a broad and unrelated theme. It does not mention any relevant facts concerning the 'onion' that aligns with the standard answer, such as the shape analogy. However, the explanation doesn't hallucinate any incorrect facts."
