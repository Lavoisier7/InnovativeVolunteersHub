{
    "score_4o": "0",
    "score_reason": "The MLLM's output provides an explanation about the power strip being in 'Identity and Unoccupied State,' which diverges completely from the standard answer focusing on the resemblance of a power strip to traffic lights. Furthermore, the explanation mentions an 'active and inactive state' which holds no relevance to the concept provided by the standard answer, leading to a disconnect in reasoning and incorrect context."

{
    "score_4o": "2",
    "score_reason": "The MLLM's output interprets the relationship as 'Antique elegance,' which misses the deeper symbolic meaning shared in the standard answer about 'prison.' While it captures elements of sophistication in the items' craftsmanship, it overlooks their metaphorical connection to the concept of confinement and authority, as suggested by the standard answer. Therefore, the MLLM response is too broad and doesn't adequately cover the reasoning provided."

{
    "score_4o": "2",
    "score_reason": "The MLLM's output discusses the similarity in 'functionality' of both objects, which is a broad and alternative connection. It doesn't address the 'seesaw' aspect from the standard answer, nor does it capture the visual similarity or connection to playgrounds. However, it correctly discusses how both objects have distinct functions, albeit generally, without any relation to the specific reasoning expected."

{
    "score_4o": "3",
    "score_reason": "The MLLM's output summarizes the relationship as structures being metaphorically referred to as 'brain-like.' It captures the visual analogy of both images, though it misses mentioning the connection to the skeleton as part of the reasoning. Therefore, while it doesn't fully encompass the standard answer, it provides a meaningful and nearly accurate description of the shared metaphorical resemblance."

    "score_reason": "The MLLM's output provides a relation described as 'Personal Touch,' highlighting individual personalization of military equipment and human connection through handwriting, which is a thematic interpretation that diverges from the standard answer 'turtle.' However, while they do not address the intended reasoning involving the shape analogy and camouflage, the MLLM's output does not contain any factual hallucinations or incorrect assertions about the images themselves."

{
    "score_4o": "2",
    "score_reason": "The MLLM's response, characterized by 'advanced washing machines,' correctly identifies the subject matter of the images as washing machines from prominent electronics brands, focusing on their domestic utility. However, it diverges significantly from the standard answer, which relates to 'camera,' introducing a different concept not aligned with the intended reasoning. As the necessary facts don't intersect with the standard explanation, this leads to a relevance gap."

    "score_reason": "The MLLM output relates the images to 'Texture and touch,' which aligns loosely with the tactile nature of both images but does not capture the specific and intended relation to 'cottoncandy' expressed in the standard answer. Additionally, the explanation does not incorporate the relevant facts about the resemblance and ingredients related to cotton candy."

{
    "score_4o": "2",
    "score_reason": "The MLLM focuses on 'radial symmetry,' which partially aligns with the concept of roundness in the standard answer related to pizza, but it lacks relevant facts about pizza or an oven, making it too broad and unrelated to the specific connection intended in the standard answer."

However, it correctly identifies the zebra's stripe pattern as a key element, although it misses the metaphorical relationship between a zebra's stripes and a crosswalk, which is the central theme in the standard answer."

However, it doesn't address the unique thematic connections of 'cane' as depicted in the standard answer. Although MLLM's explanations relate to the images correctly in terms of sugar production, it diverges from the standard focus on mobility aids like canes."
