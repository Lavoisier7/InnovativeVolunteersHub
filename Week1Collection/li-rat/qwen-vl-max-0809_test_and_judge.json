The connection between the two images lies in the contrast between the confined state of the birds and the authoritative nature of the gavel, highlighting the themes of freedom and control.",
        "judge_answer": {
            "score_4o": "3",
            "score_reason": "The MLLM's output captures the thematic elements of 'freedom' and 'authority,' which are related to the concept of 'prison.' The explanation effectively conveys the symbolic meaning of confinement and control. However, the relation 'Freedom and authority' is broader than the more specific term 'prison' used in the standard answer. The explanation does not address the analogous shapes and symbolization directly connecting to 'prison,' making the response incomplete."

        "MLLM_answer": "- First image: [Golden balance scale]\n- Second image: [Wooden playground structure with various climbing elements]\n- Relation: [Contrast]\n- Explanation: The first image depicts a golden balance scale, often symbolizing justice, fairness, and equilibrium. In contrast, the second image shows a wooden playground structure designed for physical activity and play, representing childhood, recreation, and development. The two images are unrelated in terms of theme and function, highlighting a stark contrast between the concepts of justice and childhood play.",
        "judge_answer": {
            "score_4o": "2",
            "score_reason": "The MLLM's response outlines a 'Contrast' relation, focusing on the differing symbolism of justice and childhood play. However, it doesn't address the specific similarity highlighted in the standard answer — the structural or functional resemblance between a balance scale and a seesaw. Therefore, the MLLM provides a broad interpretation rather than tying it to the intended key similarity."

        "MLLM_answer": "- First image: [Military helmet with camouflage cover]\n- Second image: [Chameleon on a branch]\n- Relation: [Camouflage]\n- Explanation: The first image shows a military helmet with a camouflage cover, which is designed to blend in with the surroundings to avoid detection. The second image features a chameleon, an animal known for its ability to change color and blend into its environment, effectively using natural camouflage. Both images share the theme of camouflage, though one is man-made and the other is a natural adaptation.",
        "judge_answer": {
            "score_4o": "2",
            "score_reason": "The MLLM's output identifies the theme as 'Camouflage,' focusing on the camouflage aspect of both the military helmet and the chameleon. This perspective is relevant but doesn't align with the standard answer's focus on the 'Turtle' connection based on shape and the inherent traits of turtles. The response is too broad and doesn't capture the intended reasoning."

        "MLLM_answer": "- First image: [Front-loading washing machine]\n- Second image: [Camera tripod]\n- Relation: [Household appliances and equipment]\n- Explanation: Both images depict items commonly found in a household. The first image shows a front-loading washing machine, which is an essential appliance for laundry tasks. The second image features a camera tripod, which is often used to stabilize cameras for photography or videography. While the direct connection between these two items may not be immediately apparent, they both serve practical purposes in different aspects of home life.",
        "judge_answer": {
            "score_4o": "2",
            "score_reason": "The MLLM's output summarizes the relationship as 'Household appliances and equipment,' which is quite broad compared to the specific connection involving a camera mentioned in the standard answer. The explanation lacks the key fact provided in the standard answer regarding the washer's round shape resembling a camera lens."

The second image is a salt shaker, typically used for adding salt to food during cooking or serving. Both items are related to everyday household use, with one focused on personal care and the other on culinary purposes.",
        "judge_answer": {
            "score_4o": "2",
            "score_reason": "The MLLM's output identifies the relationship as 'Hygiene and cooking,' which entirely misses the connection to 'cotton candy' mentioned in the standard answer. Although the explanation includes factual and logical observations, it does not align with the intended standard reasoning or the specific concept of cotton candy."

        "MLLM_answer": "- First image: [A wooden wagon wheel with metal spokes]\n- Second image: [A brick pizza oven with a dome-shaped structure]\n- Relation: [Historical craftsmanship]\n- Explanation: Both images showcase items that are representative of historical craftsmanship. The wooden wagon wheel is a classic example of early transportation technology, while the brick pizza oven reflects traditional methods of cooking and baking. Both items highlight the skill and ingenuity of past artisans in creating functional and aesthetically pleasing objects.",
        "judge_answer": {
            "score_4o": "2",
            "score_reason": "The MLLM's response focuses on the theme 'Historical craftsmanship,' which is a broad concept and does not align closely with the standard answer 'pizza.' It fails to connect the wheel and the oven to the idea of pizza, which is the key relation and explanation according to the standard answer. Nevertheless, it does correctly identify the items (wagon wheel and pizza oven), though it doesn't connect them to the intended pizza theme."

        "MLLM_answer": "- First image: [A zebra standing against a white background]\n- Second image: [A straight road with lane markings]\n- Relation: [Contrast]\n- Explanation: The first image features a zebra, which is a living creature with a distinct pattern, while the second image shows an inanimate object, specifically a road. The contrast lies in the organic versus man-made elements, as well as the static nature of the road compared to the potential movement of the zebra.",
        "judge_answer": {
            "score_4o": "2",
            "score_reason": "The MLLM's output identifies the relation as 'Contrast,' emphasizing the differences between organic (zebra) and man-made (road) elements, which is a broad interpretation. It does not reference the specific connection to 'crosswalk,' as indicated in the standard answer, but instead offers a different perspective. This summary includes relevant concepts of contrast but misses the specific relation that is 'crosswalk,' thus aligning partially in broad terms but missing the direct theme connection."

The second image depicts a wheelchair, a mobility device designed to assist individuals with limited mobility. There is no apparent direct connection between these two images as they represent completely different subjects.",
        "judge_answer": {
            "score_4o": "2",
            "score_reason": "The MLLM's response identifies 'no direct connection' between the two images, asserting that they represent different subjects. Although it correctly describes the images separately, it doesn't identify the indirect relation based on their similar shapes, as highlighted in the standard answer, which explains the relationship through the shared concept of a 'cane.'"

The second image shows a bunch of fresh carrots, which are vegetables. The connection between these two images is primarily one of contrast, as they represent vastly different subjects—one being a cultural and religious symbol, and the other being a common food item. There is no direct thematic or shared element linking the two images beyond this contrast.",
        "judge_answer": {
            "score_4o": "2",
            "score_reason": "The MLLM's output categorizes the relationship as 'Contrast,' highlighting the different subjects of a Russian Orthodox church and fresh carrots. While this assertion of contrast is factual, it doesn't capture the specific connection described in the standard answer related to 'onion.' Additionally, the MLLM fails to reference any relevant facts concerning the shape similarities that form the basis of the standard answer."
