        "MLLM_answer": "- First image: A black slotted spatula.\n- Second image: A mosquito.\n\n- Relation: Pest control\n\n- Explanation: The spatula is a kitchen utensil primarily used for flipping or tossing food. However, in a humorous context, it could be used for swatting mosquitoes. Mosquitoes are common pests, and many household items are often repurposed to manage or eliminate them.",
        "judge_answer": {
            "score_4o": "2",
            "score_reason": "The MLLM suggests a humorous connection to pest control, missing the explicit shape connection to 'flyswatter,' which is key in the standard answer."

        "MLLM_answer": "- First image: Striped colorful vase\n- Second image: Gothic-style coffin with skeleton decoration\n- Relation: Contrast\n- Explanation: The first image features a vibrant, colorful vase with horizontal stripes, conveying a sense of energy and cheerfulness. In stark contrast, the second image depicts a dark, gothic-style coffin adorned with a skeleton motif, evoking themes of death and mystery. The juxtaposition highlights differences in mood, color, and symbolism.",
        "judge_answer": {
            "score_4o": "2",
            "score_reason": "While highlighting contrast in themes, the MLLM does not reference the shape connection to 'urn,' which is critical in the standard answer."

    "trafficlights(invisible, stuff, mutual elements, NA, English)": {
        "MLLM_answer": "- First image: Power strip with multiple outlets\n- Second image: No left turn traffic sign\n- Relation: Restrictions\n- Explanation: Both images involve the concept of restrictions. The power strip has covered outlets, which could signify limiting access or use to prevent overloading, while the no left turn sign indicates a traffic restriction. Both serve to control behavior in different contexts, one related to electrical safety and the other to road safety.",
        "judge_answer": {
            "score_4o": "2",
            "score_reason": "The MLLM discusses restrictions but does not connect to the specific relevant shape-based connection with 'trafficlights,' as discussed in the standard answer."

    "prison(invisible, stuff, mutual elements, NA, English)": {
        "MLLM_answer": "- First image: Birdcage\n- Second image: Judge’s gavel\n- Relation: Freedom and restraint\n- Explanation: The birdcage symbolizes containment and the lack of freedom, representing physical or metaphorical entrapment. Meanwhile, the judge's gavel symbolizes law and order, which can also impose constraints but is associated with justice and decision-making. Together, these images evoke themes of restriction and liberation, as well as the idea of authority and the enforcement of rules.",
        "judge_answer": {
            "score_4o": "2",
            "score_reason": "The thematic link to 'freedom and restraint' is too broad and misses the specific connection to 'prison,' essential to the reasoning in the standard answer."

    "seesaw(invisible, stuff, mutual elements, NA, English)": {
        "MLLM_answer": "- First image: Unbalanced scales\n- Second image: Playground climbing frame\n- Relation: Balance and movement\n- Explanation: The unbalanced scales represent the concept of imbalance or inequality, often seen as a metaphor for justice or fairness. The playground climbing frame is a structure for physical activity and play, which involves balance and movement challenges. Both images involve themes of equilibrium—whether literal, as in physical play structures, or metaphorical, as in justice and fairness.",
        "judge_answer": {
            "score_4o": "2",
            "score_reason": "Discussing balance is broad and does not link to the 'seesaw,' which is primarily about the specific physical and shape analogies given in the standard answer."

        "MLLM_answer": "- First image: Walnut resembling a brain\n- Second image: Human skeleton\n\n- Relation: Anatomy\n\n- Explanation: The first image shows a walnut, which is humorously noted for its resemblance to the human brain, highlighting an informal link to human anatomy. The second image depicts a human skeleton, directly relating to human anatomy as it is a core component of the body structure. Both images explore elements connected to the anatomy of humans—one through visual metaphor and the other through actual biological representation.",
        "judge_answer": {
            "score_4o": "3",
            "score_reason": "The MLLM makes a connection to human anatomy, correctly identifying the walnut's resemblance to a brain and the skeleton, paralleling the standard answer without specifying the detailed connections."

    "turtle(invisible, animal, mutual elements, NA, English)": {
        "MLLM_answer": "- First image: Camouflage helmet\n- Second image: Chameleon on a branch\n- Relation: Camouflage\n- Explanation: Both the helmet and the chameleon feature camouflage patterns. The helmet uses a mottled green and brown design typical of military attire for blending into forested environments. Similarly, the chameleon has natural coloration that helps it blend into its surroundings, serving as a biological form of camouflage.",
        "judge_answer": {
            "score_4o": "3",
            "score_reason": "The MLLM successfully identifies camouflage, mirroring real and metaphorical uses. However, it misses the specific shape analogy to 'turtle' from the standard answer."

        "MLLM_answer": "- First image: Washing machine\n- Second image: Tripod\n\n- Relation: Household items\n\n- Explanation: Both images feature common household items, but they serve different purposes. The first image shows a washing machine, an appliance used for cleaning clothes, while the second image displays a tripod, a tool often used to stabilize cameras or other devices for photography or videography.",
        "judge_answer": {

        "MLLM_answer": "- First image: Cotton balls\n- Second image: Sugar dispenser\n- Relation: White appearance\n- Explanation: Both images feature items that are white in color—cotton balls and sugar. This shared color gives them a visual similarity despite their different uses and materials. Cotton balls are commonly used for personal care, while sugar is a food ingredient.",
        "judge_answer": {
            "score_4o": "2",

The wooden wagon wheel is a testament to historical woodworking techniques used in transportation, while the pizza oven showcases masonry skills used to create reliable cooking structures. These objects reflect the enduring nature of past construction methods.",
        "judge_answer": {
            "score_4o": "2",
            "score_reason": "Discussion of craftsmanship is overly broad and lacks the shape and utility connection to 'pizza,' important in the standard answer."

        "MLLM_answer": "- First image: Zebra\n- Second image: Road with dashed lines\n- Relation: Stripes\n- Explanation: Both images prominently feature stripes. The zebra is characterized by its natural black and white striped pattern, while the road has painted white dashed lines running along it. These visual elements draw a parallel between the two images.",
        "judge_answer": {
            "score_4o": "3",
            "score_reason": "The MLLM identifies stripes as a key feature but does not explicitly connect it to 'crosswalk' and its specific reasoning, although it largely aligns."

    "cane(invisible, stuff, mutual elements, NA, English)": {
        "MLLM_answer": "- First image: Sugarcane\n- Second image: Wheelchair\n- Relation: Unrelated\n- Explanation: The first image shows sugarcane, a tropical plant used for making sugar. The second image depicts a wheelchair, a mobility aid for individuals with difficulties walking. These items do not share a direct connection, as one is agricultural and the other is a medical device.",
        "judge_answer": {
            "score_4o": "1",
            "score_reason": "The MLLM incorrectly claims no connection, missing the actual shape and function analogy with 'cane,' which is critical in the explanation."

        "MLLM_answer": "- First image: Illustration of a building with onion domes\n- Second image: Bunch of fresh carrots\n\n- Relation: Shape resemblance\n- Explanation: The building in the first image features onion domes, which have a shape similar to the elongated and rounded form of the carrots in the second image. This resemblance is due to the rounded bulbous tops of both the domes and the carrots. The visual similarity connects the architectural style with the natural form.",
        "judge_answer": {
            "score_4o": "4",
            "score_reason": "The MLLM captures the visual resemblance between the two images efficiently and links the architectural feature's shape adequately with the natural form, consistent with the standard answer. Although the MLLM output talks about carrots, it correctly identifies the shape resemblance theme, paralleling onion bulbs in the standard approach."
