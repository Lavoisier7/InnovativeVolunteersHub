        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM output does not align well with the intended standard reasoning, missing the critical elements of chaos theory examples, such as weather patterns and the double pendulum. It only discusses data visualization superficially."

        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM output accurately identifies the images as molecular structures but does not address or align with the deeper context of quantum entanglement. The explanation does not engage with the standard reasoning focusing on quantum principles."

        "score_4o": "1",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM simply lists the event horizon, without connecting to the broader theme of black holes. It displays some understanding of the term but misses the intended reasoning tied to gravitational effects of black holes."

    "Artificial intelligence1(visible, STEM, mutual elements, NA, English)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The response captures the theme of technological advancement, but it fails to relate these elements directly to artificial intelligence as in the standard answer. The connection made is overly broad and misses the specific AI applications."

        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM output identifies DNA structure but lacks mention of the genetic code aspect. It falls short of connecting the imagery to the genetic information concept and related genetic map, which are central to the standard answer."

        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The output suggests a theme of technological evolution but does not align with the intended concept of quantum superposition. It lacks the depth required to associate the images with the nuances of quantum mechanics described in the standard answer."

        "score_4o": "1",

        "score_4o": "3",
        "score_reason": "The explanation of high frequency of events somewhat captures chaos theory concepts but lacks the precise application to traffic jams and heart rate variability. It's reasonable but incomplete in capturing the full depth."

        "score_4o": "1",
        "score_reason": "The focus on chess in MLLM’s output doesn't connect to the Pythagorean theorem or the geometric reasoning demonstrated in the standard answer. It provides a vague recognition of structure without mathematical insight."

    "The butterfly effect2(visible, STEM, relation, NA, English)": {
        "score_4o": "3",
        "score_reason": "MLLM relates the visual patterns to nature but stops short of linking to the specific theme of the butterfly effect, though it neatly captures visual interesting patterns. It's accurate but somewhat lacks direct depth in chaos theory."

    "The butterfly effect3(visible, STEM, relation, NA, English)": {
        "score_4o": "3",
        "score_reason": "The emotional and thematic contrasts in nature are depicted well but the link to the butterfly effect is not clearly included beyond a general observation of nature's capacity. It generally aligns but lacks direct theoretical mention."

        "score_reason": "The MLLM output touches upon the concept of security and genetic makeup but does not mention CRISPR technology, which is central to the standard answer. It misses the precise connection of CRISPR acting as a 'key' to unlock DNA, sticking instead to a broad theme of security and identity."
