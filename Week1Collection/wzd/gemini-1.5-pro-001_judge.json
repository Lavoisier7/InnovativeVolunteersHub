        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output captures a significant part of the explanation related to 'Genetic information.' It correctly describes the DNA and gene map within the context of genetic information, but does not fully align with the term 'Genetic code' employed in the standard answer."

    "Quantum superposition1(invisible, STEM, mutual elements, NA, English)": {
        "score_4o": "3",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM output mentions 'Quantum mechanics,' which relates to 'Quantum superposition.' However, it lacks the key concepts of superposition, a more precise term found in the standard answer."

    "Fractals1(invisible, STEM, metaphor, NA, English)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output is somewhat relevant but misses the intended 'Fractals' relationship. The explanation focuses on 'Erosion,' which does not align with the fractal connection referenced in the standard answer."

    "Chaos theory2(invisible, STEM, metaphor, NA, English)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The concept of 'Congestion' proposed by the MLLM output doesn't align with the 'Chaos theory' theme emphasized in the standard answer. The connection drawn is overly broad and lacks depth."

    "The Pythagorean theorem(invisible, STEM, mutual elements, NA, English)": {
        "score_4o": "3",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's response discusses 'Geometry in practice,' which partially overlaps with the 'Pythagorean theorem.' The connection is valid but lacks the specific focus on the theorem's illustrated application in the standard answer."
    },
    "The Pythagorean theorem1(invisible, STEM, metaphor, NA, English)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's relation of 'Ascending' misses the intended connection to 'The Pythagorean theorem' found in the standard answer. Additionally, the explanation diverges significantly from the depth and specificity related to Pythagorean concepts."

    "The Pythagorean theorem2(invisible, STEM, metaphor, NA, English)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The explanation of 'Strategic movement and spatial reasoning' diverges significantly from the intended 'The Pythagorean theorem.' It lacks critical elements related to geometry mentioned in the standard answer."

        "score_4o": "4",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output correctly identifies the concept of 'Photosynthesis,' describing the sun's role and green leaf in the photosynthesis process, which corresponds accurately to the standard answer."

    "The butterfly effect(visible, STEM, relation, NA, English)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's explanation of 'Juxtaposition of beauty and danger' strays from the specific linkage of 'The butterfly effect' found in the standard answer; therefore, it's broad and misses the concise connections aimed in chaos theory."
    },
    "The butterfly effect1(visible, STEM, relation, NA, English)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "While the MLLM discusses 'Transformation and Growth,' it diverges from the precise 'The butterfly effect' concept in the standard answer, lacking critical connection points related to chaos theory."
    },
    "The butterfly effect2(visible, STEM, relation, NA, English)": {
        "score_4o": "4",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's answer captures the concept of 'Butterfly Effect' as described by the standard answer. It correctly notes how small changes like a butterfly can lead to unpredictable outcomes, matching the established explanation."
    },
    "The butterfly effect3(visible, STEM, relation, NA, English)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The concept of 'Fragility' misses the specific idea of 'The butterfly effect' in the standard answer. It focuses on a more general dual theme rather than the intended chain reaction narrative."

    "Big Bang theory(invisible, STEM, metaphor, NA, English)": {
        "score_4o": "1",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM requests additional input, failing to expand on the provided image and relationship, which leads to an incomplete evaluation."

        "score_4o": "4",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM accurately captures the relation 'Gene editing' comparable to 'CRISPR technology' as expressed in the standard answer. The explanation of the scissors metaphor aligns well with the intended reasoning."

    "CRISPR technology1(invisible, STEM, relation, NA, English)": {
        "score_4o": "3",
        "score_reason": "While 'Building blocks' is relevant, it reflects a broader intersection rather than the precise 'CRISPR technology' analogy discussed in the standard answer. The analogy to building blocks of DNA and code misses some specific CRISPR aspects."

    "CRISPR technology2(invisible, STEM, relation, NA, English)": {
        "score_4o": "3",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM output understands the concept of unlocking genetic information, which is an element of what CRISPR technology does. However, it lacks the specificity and detail relating to CRISPR technology as mentioned in the standard answer."
