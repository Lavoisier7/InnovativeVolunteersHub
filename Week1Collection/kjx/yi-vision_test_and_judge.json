The second image shows a typewriter keyboard with numbers and letters arranged in rows. The relation between these two images lies in the visual contrast between the human facial expression and the mechanical keyboard layout, both of which convey a sense of surprise through their respective elements.

The hourglass, a classic representation of time, shows the sand gradually trickling from one bulb to the other, signifying the continuous flow of minutes and hours. The overripe apple, on the other hand, displays physical signs of decay with its browning and shriveling skin, representing the natural aging process that all living things undergo.

The first image shows a person physically pushing a large boulder, which symbolizes the struggle against a powerful force. The second image shows a small plant growing through a crack in concrete, which represents determination and resilience in the face of adversity. The common element is the portrayal of struggle and triumph against seemingly insurmountable challenges.",

The first image shows a single lightning bolt with a heart-shaped center, while the second image depicts multiple lightning bolts. The common theme in both images is the stormy atmosphere, and the shared element is the lightning strike, which is a powerful natural phenomenon.

The child and the older person are both focused on their books, highlighting the timeless nature of reading as a personal and immersive experience. The presence of smoke in the second image adds a layer of complexity, possibly suggesting a contemplative or nostalgic atmosphere, while the child's innocent engagement in the first image conveys a sense of curiosity and learning.",
        "judge_answer": {
            "score_4o": "2",
            "score_reason": "The MLLM output identifies the surface similarity between the two imagesâ€”individuals engaged in readingâ€”but it does not align with the thematic connection in the standard answer. The standard answer connects the images to the proverb 'Was HÃ¤nschen nicht lernt, lernt Hans nimmermehr,' which speaks to missed opportunities and lifelong consequences of early learning. The MLLM's explanation touches on the act of reading and atmospheric elements but does not convey this deeper symbolic relation."

The palette represents a variety of colors used in art, while the globe represents the diverse continents of the world. The connection between them is the display of different elements that make up a whole, whether it is a painting or the Earth.",

The first image shows a rock climber engaging in a risky and adventurous activity by balancing on a rope high above the ground. The second image features a treasure chest full of gold coins, which often symbolizes the rewards and allure of embarking on a perilous journey. The common theme of adventure ties these two images together, suggesting that both activities are thrilling, challenging, and potentially rewarding.",

The common theme between the two images is the presence of desserts, which suggests a setting where people are enjoying sweet treats.",

The first image shows a person walking through the forest, while the second image depicts a wolf hiding behind a tree. The forest provides a natural environment for both the person and the wolf, creating a connection between the two images.",
        "judge_answer": {

            "score_reason": "The MLLM's output identifies the relation as 'Forest setting,' which is a broad and general theme and misses the specific relation to 'RotkÃ¤ppchen und der Wolf' (Little Red Riding Hood and the Wolf). The explanation discusses the forest as the connecting element without recognizing the iconic symbols of the story: the red cloak and the wolf. It fails to capture the essence and deeper meaning found in the standard answer, which connects the red cloak and the wolf to the classic fairy tale's themes of innocence and danger. Therefore, it receives a score of 2 as it lacks relevant and specific facts tied to the standard answer's reasoning."

The first image shows a fisherman taking a break on his boat, while the second image captures a moment of active fishing with a fisherman hauling in a net filled with fish. The common theme between the two images is the fishing profession, highlighting different aspects of a fisherman's life - rest and active work.",

            "score_reason": "The MLLM's output identifies the relation as 'Fishing profession,' which is a connection between the images. However, it does not capture the deeper thematic essence of the proverb 'Chi dorme non piglia pesci,' which is about the missed opportunities due to inaction and the success when taking action. The explanation thus fails to address the intended reason in the standard answer, focusing instead on the general aspects of a fisherman's life without the thematic insight related to seizing vs. missing opportunities."

The first image shows a ceiling adorned with elaborate frescoes and gold accents, characteristic of Baroque art. The second image portrays a grand hall with ornate decorations, crystal chandeliers, and large windows, reflecting a similar level of luxury and sophistication.

The first image evokes a sense of abandonment and decay, suggesting a start from a low point, much like a blank canvas. The second image, with its single flame, signifies hope, warmth, and a fresh start. Both images, while visually different, can be seen as metaphors for beginnings, with the first image representing the potential for growth from desolation and the second image showing a literal light in the darkness.",

            "score_reason": "The MLLM output describes a theme of 'Rebirth or new beginning,' focusing on potential growth and hope. This is quite different from the standard answer, which centers on hopelessness and a warning from Dante's Inferno. However, the MLLM's explanation does capture some elements related to change and potential shifts, which tangentially connects to the quote 'Abandon all hope, ye who enter here,' where the contrast between hope and despair could be inferred. Nevertheless, the explanation doesn't align closely with the intended reasoning or relationship in the standard answer."

The first image shows a man in a modern, formal suit, which is a standard attire for business or formal events in many cultures. The second image shows a man in a brown robe, which is more traditional and possibly associated with a religious order or monastic community. The common element between the two images is the traditional aspect of their clothing, highlighting how different cultures express formality and tradition through attire.",

Instead, it focuses on attire styles without addressing the deeper meaning about outward appearances and true character as described in the standard answer. However, mentioning that the images depict distinct styles of attire partially aligns with the images' representation of outer appearances, which earns it a score of 2 for being broadly correct."
