        "score_4o": "3",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM output identifies the theme as 'speed,' which is somewhat similar to the standard answer's 'running ability.' The explanation emphasizes speed as a crucial element in both the cheetah's and the athlete's depictions, aligning with the standard answer's mention of 'exceptional running ability.' However, it does not specifically mention Usain Bolt, which would have directly addressed the standard reasoning more effectively."

        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output labels the relationship as 'Sports and Insects,' which does not align with the standard answer 'jumping ability.' While it recognizes the images' subjects as different aspects of life, it misses the specific connection of their shared ability to jump. Therefore, the explanation is too broad and lacks relevant facts from the standard answer."

        "score_4o": "3",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output captures the broad concept of 'artistic expression,' which is similar to the 'painting ability' in the standard answer.

    "brightness and power(visible, ability, relation, NA, English)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output identifies 'Lighting' as the relation, which is correct but lacks depth compared to the standard answer of 'brightness and power.' The explanation provided by the MLLM focuses on the physical aspect of lighting, whereas the standard answer delves into the metaphorical analogy of computing power. This shows that the MLLM's response is broad and doesn't capture the intended intellectual connection."

        "score_4o": "3",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output identifies the relation as 'Cooking,' which is closely related to the standard answer 'cooking ability.' The explanation includes the idea that both images are related to cooking but falls short of effectively summarizing the spectrum of cooking ability from mastery to disaster.

        "score_4o": "0",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM includes incorrect facts in its response. It erroneously implies that a ballet dancer requires mobility aids like a ballet barre to perform, which is not accurate. The dancer's performance does not necessitate such aids in the context of professional ballet. The MLLM fails to recognize the individual in a wheelchair as Stephen Hawking, leading to a misinterpretation of the images' relation and explanation."

        "score_4o": "3",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output defines the relationship as 'Planning,' which is closely related to 'management ability' as described in the standard answer, while emphasizing the elements of organization and foresight. However, the explanation lacks the detailed connection to 'Time Management and Work Arrangement Management' and does not fully address the intertwined nature of these concepts as expressed in the standard reasoning. Therefore, it is similar but incomplete."

        "score_4o": "4",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's explanation accurately conveys the meaning and relationship presented in the standard answer. It correctly identifies the open door as a symbol of opportunity or new beginnings and the keys as representing access or unlocking potential, aligning closely with the standard answer's reference to keys representing skill or talent.

        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output connects both the cat and the magnifying glass to 'Observation,' which is similar to the standard answer's theme of 'Curiosity.' However, it misses the explicit mention of 'curiosity' and does not effectively summarize the relationship as indicated in the standard answer. Still, the explanation aligns partially with the complete reasoning, capturing the essence of curiosity-driven observation."

    "ability to grow(invisible, ability, relation, NA, English)": {
        "score_4o": "4",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output aligns closely with the standard answer. It identifies the theme of 'growth,' which is consistent with the relationship 'ability to grow' in the standard answer.

    "Potential to perform(invisible, ability, metaphor, NA, English)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output summarizes the relationship as 'Lighting equipment,' focusing on the physical aspects of the images rather than the abstract concept of 'Potential to perform,' which the standard answer discusses. The explanation also centers around the imagery of stage and lighting rather than notions of opportunity and talent, which align with the standard reasoning. Therefore, while factually correct, the response does not capture the intended conceptual depth of the standard answer."

        "score_4o": "4",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output accurately identifies the relation as 'communication,' which aligns with the notion of 'message passing' in the standard answer.

        "score_4o": "4",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM output is entirely consistent with the standard answer. Both describe the first image as representing a neural network connected to artificial intelligence and the second image as a robot using AI to play chess.

The explanation about bubbles being related to the vastness of space and comets representing the macrocosm of the cosmos does not align with the intended reasoning, which revolves around the ephemeral nature of both bubbles and celestial phenomena. Thus, the response is too broad and fails to capture the key relationship identified in the standard answer."

        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output captures a broad connection by relating both images to 'Healthcare.' However, it does not mention the specific concept of 'Placebo effect' or relevant elements found in the standard answer. It lacks deeper insight into the significance of the placebo and the doctor's role in the placebo effect, as described in the standard explanation."

    "mysterious and unknown dark matter(invisible, phenomenon, relation, NA, English)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output uses 'complexity' as the relation, which is too broad and not closely related to the standard answer of 'mysterious and unknown dark matter.' While the concept of complexity might encompass elements of mystery and unknown phenomena, the reasoning behind the images connecting to dark matter, particularly through gravitational lensing and the representation of dark matter as unknown, is not addressed."

    "Crop Circles(visible, phenomenon, relation, NA, English)": {
        "score_4o": "3",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output summarizes the relationship as 'Alien activity.' This is similar but not identical to the standard answer's 'Crop Circles.' The MLLM correctly identifies crop circles and UFOs as being associated with theories about alien activity, which aligns partially with the standard answer's explanation of the connection to extraterrestrial visitors and spacecraft. However, it doesn't focus primarily on crop circles, slightly differing from the standard explanation."
    },
    "the passage of time(invisible, phenomenon, relation, NA, English)": {
        "score_4o": "3",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output summarizes the relationship as 'Time and Decay,' which is related but not exactly the same as the standard answer 'the passage of time.' The explanation provided is similar to the standard answer in that it highlights the hourglass and the rotten apple's connection to the passage of time, but it does not mention decay as an effect of time on organic matter, which is a key element of the standard explanation."
    },
    "Gravity(invisible, phenomenon, mutual elements, NA, English)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM concludes that there is no apparent connection between the images, which is too broad and does not align with the specific connection 'Gravity' identified in the standard answer. The MLLM does not mention any key concepts such as the anecdote about Newton and the significance of the black hole in relation to gravity, which would have aligned more closely with the standard explanation."

    "Perseverance(invisible, phenomenon, mutual elements, NA, English)": {
        "score_4o": "3",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output describes the connection between the images as 'Struggle,' which is somewhat aligned with the 'Perseverance' theme in the standard answer. The explanation correctly identifies the themes of struggle and overcoming obstacles in both images, but it misses the nuance of the Sisyphus myth and the concept of persisting despite difficulty."
    },
    "Hope and new beginnings(invisible, phenomenon, metaphor, NA, English)": {
        "score_4o": "3",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output describes the relation as 'Journey,' focusing on transition moments. While the 'Journey' theme aligns somewhat with the overall idea of hope and new beginnings, the explanation doesn't delve into the symbolism of overcoming challenges and emerging into new light as the standard answer suggests. The explanation captures a similar idea of transition, but from a slightly different perspective."
    },
    "3D(invisible, phenomenon, mutual elements, NA, English)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM output categorizes the relationship as 'Astronomy,' which is a broad theme relevant to the images but not as specific as the standard answer's focus on '3D.' The explanation vaguely describes celestial events and the phase of the moon, without delving into the specific dynamic physical interactions and details related to the solar eclipse as highlighted in the standard answer."
    },
    "Supernova(visible, phenomenon, relation, NA, English)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output claims the relation is 'Astronomy,' which is too broad and does not capture the specific concept of a 'Supernova' as stated in the standard answer. However, it does mention space and nuclear reactors, which are related to celestial phenomena and elements studied in astronomy. The explanation does not align in terms of the reasoning given in the standard answer."

        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output summarizes the relation as 'Lightning,' which is related but not entirely aligned with the specific concept of 'Ball lightning.' It correctly identifies the presence of lightning in both images but does not mention the more focused phenomenon of 'Ball lightning' found in the standard answer."

    "Sun dog(invisible, phenomenon, mutual elements, NA, English)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM describes the images in terms of 'Contrast,' focusing on the temperature difference between sunlight and snowflakes. This explanation and reasoning do not connect with the concept of 'Sun dog' as in the standard answer, which involves refraction of sunlight through ice crystals. It broadly refers to warmth and coldness but lacks relevant facts from the standard answer."

        "score_4o": "4",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output summarizes the relationship as 'Earthquakes' and provides an explanation that aligns closely with the standard answer. Both address the connection between fault lines and the generation of seismic waves during earthquakes, accurately capturing the cause-and-effect relationship explained in the standard answer."

    "Migration(invisible, phenomenon, relation, NA, English)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output captures the broad theme of 'Nature,' which is related but too general compared to the more specific 'Migration' relation in the standard answer. It does acknowledge the concept of transformation and motion in nature, yet it fails to mention any factual elements related to the migration behavior of birds in response to changing seasons, as highlighted in the standard answer."
    },
    "Light pillar(invisible, phenomenon, relation, NA, English)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output identifies a general winter theme for both images, which is overly broad. The standard answer specifically identifies the concept of 'Light pillar' and explains the relationship in terms of light reflection off ice crystals, which the MLLM overlooks. Thus, while the MLLM captures the seasonal aspect, it fails to capture the more specific phenomenon described in the standard answer."
    },
    "Cancel Culture(invisible, phenomenon, mutual elements, NA, English)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "MLLM's output relates the images to 'Destruction,' which is a broad theme that loosely aligns with the standard answer. However, it fails to capture the specific concept of 'Cancel Culture.' It does mention destruction, analogous to the destruction of ideas, but lacks the context of silencing and deplatforming linked to cancel culture."
    },
    "Viral Trend(invisible, phenomenon, mutual elements, NA, English)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output describes the connection between the images as 'Action,' which is too broad and does not capture the more specific 'Viral Trend' concept of the standard answer. However, it does correctly identify that the images depict people engaging with their environment, but fails to mention the key facts related to the specific phenomena of 'Ice Bucket Challenge' and 'TikTok dance crazes' that the standard answer highlights."
    },
    "reinforce opinions(invisible, phenomenon, mutual elements, NA, English)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output addresses the concept of 'media,' which is somewhat related to the standard answer's focus on different environments that reinforce the same perspectives, as media could be a facilitator of an echo chamber. However, it does not identify the specific concept of 'reinforce opinions' or 'echo chamber' as the standard answer does. The explanation lacks details specific to digital or social echo chambers, missing the nuanced reasoning behind the images."
    },
    "Influencer Marketing(invisible, phenomenon, relation, NA, English)": {
        "score_4o": "3",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output identifies 'Marketing' as the relation, which is broadly correlated with 'Influencer Marketing' but lacks specificity. However, the explanation aligns with the standard answer, highlighting product promotion leading to increased sales, though it misses the detail about 'influencer marketing' specifically."

    "Greenhouse effect(invisible, phenomenon, relation, NA, English)": {
        "score_4o": "3",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output identifies 'Environmental Impact' as the relation, which is not as specific as the standard answer 'Greenhouse effect.' However, the explanation recognizes the connection between vehicle emissions and climate change, aligning somewhat with the greenhouse effect discussed in the standard answer. The key aspects of cause (vehicle emissions) and effect (melting ice caps) are mentioned, although it lacks the precise terminology and linkage seen in the standard answer."
    },
    "Magna Carta(invisible, phenomenon, relation, NA, English)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output identifies the portrait as a historical figure and the pavilion as potentially part of a historical site, suggesting a vague relationship with historical significance. However, it does not specifically mention King John, the Magna Carta, or Runnymede, missing the precise connection indicated in the standard answer. Therefore, the answer is too broad and doesn’t include relevant facts related to the specific historical significance of the Magna Carta."
    },
    "Prayer(invisible, phenomenon, metaphor, NA, English)": {
        "score_4o": "4",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's response accurately conveys the central theme of 'Prayer,' consistent with the standard answer. It captures the essence of both images—the kneeling figure and the open hands raised towards the sky—as representative of reverence and connection to a higher power. The explanation aligns well with the standard reasoning, emphasizing themes common to prayer such as humility, reverence, and supplication."
    },
    "Stille Wasser sind tief(invisible, phenomenon, metaphor, Non-English European, German)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's response connects the two images through a broad 'Nature' theme, emphasizing the visual elements of the serene lake and sunlight through a cave. However, it doesn't address the deeper metaphorical connection referenced in the standard answer, namely 'Still waters run deep.' This demonstrates a surface-level understanding of the imagery without connecting to the intended meaning of hidden depths beneath calm appearances."
    },
    "Der Apfel fällt nicht weit vom Stamm(invisible, phenomenon, metaphor, Non-English European, German)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM correctly identifies that both images involve apples but does not address the deeper metaphorical meaning encapsulated by the German proverb 'Der Apfel fällt nicht weit vom Stamm.' The output focuses on the literal representation without connecting it to the intended figurative expression about resemblance. Thus, it is roughly correct but too broad, lacking the relevant explanation in the standard answer."
    },
    "Man lernt nie aus(invisible, ability, metaphor, Non-English European, German)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output describes the relationship as 'Structure,' which is too broad and doesn't align with the standard answer 'Man lernt nie aus.' The explanation focuses on the structural elements of the images, rather than the theme of continuous learning and growth as described in the standard answer. The MLLM does not address the idea of lifelong learning or connect it to the open book and staircase, missing the thematic link provided in the standard answer."
    },
    "Übung macht den Meister.(invisible, ability, metaphor, Non-English European, German)": {
        "score_4o": "3",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output describes the common theme of artistic expression, which is partially correct but doesn't pinpoint the more precise connection of 'Übung macht den Meister' (Practice makes perfect) from the standard answer. While the MLLM does mention elements related to artistic endeavors requiring skill and dedication, it does not specifically connect this to the concept of practice leading to mastery as highlighted in the standard answer."

    "Was Hänschen nicht lernt, lernt Hans nimmermehr(invisible, ability, metaphor, Non-English European, German)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output relates the two images to the act of reading and a lifelong engagement with books, which captures a broad theme of reading but does not delve into the precise philosophical meaning and proverbial interpretation presented in the standard answer. It lacks the nuance of contrasting 'learning in youth' with 'missed opportunities in age,' which is central to the explanation provided in the standard answer."
    },
    "Die Welt ist meine Vorstellung(invisible, culture, metaphor, Non-English European, German)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output relates to 'Geography,' which is too broad and does not closely align with the standard answer 'Die Welt ist meine Vorstellung.' The explanation also lacks the connection to creativity and imagination that the painter's palette and globe represent according to the standard answer, but it suggests a general theme of exploration and understanding."
    },
    "Wer nicht wagt, der nicht gewinnt(invisible, culture, metaphor, Non-English European, German)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output describes the relationship as 'Wealth,' which only roughly correlates with the standard answer of 'Wer nicht wagt, der nicht gewinnt' (He who doesn't dare, doesn't win). The explanation mentions both risk-taking and wealth, with the MLLM emphasizing themes of 'wealth and adventure,' while the standard answer focuses on the philosophy of risk and reward. However, the MLLM lacks a direct link to the idiom or clear articulation of the principle outlined in the standard answer."

        "score_4o": "3",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output identifies the relationship as 'Coffee and Dessert,' which is roughly correct but lacks the cultural aspect of 'Kaffee und Kuchen' as described in the standard answer. The explanation captures the idea of enjoying sweet treats and beverages, aligning with the social and cozy atmosphere of the tradition, but it misses specific mention of cultural significance such as the German tradition or the specific Black Forest cake."

        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output identifies 'Forest' as the relation, which is too broad and misses the more specific connection of the fairy tale 'Rotkäppchen und der Wolf' (Little Red Riding Hood and the Wolf). While it correctly identifies a common setting as the forest, it fails to link the red cloak to Little Red Riding Hood and the wolf to the fairy tale, thus missing the intended cultural and narrative connections outlined in the standard answer."

        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output summarizes the relationship as 'Mood,' which aligns thematically with the sense of mystery and suspense, but lacks the specific connection to Dante's 'Inferno' that is highlighted in the standard answer. The explanation partially acknowledges the mood evoked by the images, but does not address the deeper literary reference and themes of despair and fragile hope."

        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's explanation focuses on the clothing aspect, depicting a man in a suit and another in a robe, suggesting a theme of formality. However, it misses the actual nuanced connection related to the proverb 'L’abito non fa il monaco,' which is about the disjunction between appearance and character. The response is broad, as it doesn't incorporate the key idea of inner character versus outward appearance that is present in the standard answer."

        "score_4o": "3",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output correctly identifies the overall theme of 'fashion' based on the two images, which aligns with the standard answer's identification of Italian fashion as the central theme. However, it doesn't specifically mention 'Italian fashion' or link the relationship to the more nuanced and specific themes of Milan Fashion Week and Italian craftsmanship that are highlighted in the standard answer. Thus, the response is incomplete in capturing the full depth of the standard answer's explanation."
