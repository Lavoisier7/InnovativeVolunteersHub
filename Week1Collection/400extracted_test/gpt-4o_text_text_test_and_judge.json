Albert Camus's \"The Stranger\" embodies existentialist themes, exploring the absurdity of life and death through its protagonist, Meursault.

Binoculars, on the other hand, are optical tools that enhance one's ability to see over long distances. The shared element between these two is 'vision': the \"evileyepearl\" symbolically relates to being seen and protecting against harmful gazes, while binoculars practically extend human sight.
