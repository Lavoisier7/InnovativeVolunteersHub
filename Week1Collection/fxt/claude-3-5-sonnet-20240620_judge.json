    "Ho visto del vino e ho bevuto(invisible, country, metaphor, Non-English European, Italian)": {
        "score_4o": "0",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM focuses on sensory experiences and perception, failing to capture the dual meaning of 'vino' as both 'wine' and 'I saw' in Italian. This key linguistic feature is missed, resulting in a factual inaccuracy concerning the link between the images and the standard reasoning."

        "score_4o": "0",

        "score_reason": "The MLLM's explanation about unexpected consequences lacks the understanding of linguistic elements, particularly '사과' (apple) and '사고' (accident) which are vital for the humor in the standard answer. The reasoning presented is inaccurate."
