        "MLLM_answer": "- First image: A hand holding a vintage alarm clock.\n- Second image: A hand holding a vintage alarm clock with sparkling particles coming off the clock face.\n- Relation: Time is passing.\n- Explanation: Both images show a hand holding an antique alarm clock, however, the second image shows the clock with sparkling particles coming off the face, suggesting that time is passing. The particles could symbolize the moments or seconds disappearing. The images are a visual metaphor for the fleeting nature of time. \n",

        "MLLM_answer": "- First image: A close up of a human eye, with the iris clearly visible, and the eyelashes surrounding the eye.\n- Second image: Snow-covered trees in a forest with a pathway leading into the forest.\n- Relation: Contrast\n- Explanation: The first image is a close-up of a human eye, which suggests the beauty of nature.  The second image is of a snow-covered forest, which shows the beauty of the natural world and the serenity of winter. They are contrasted in terms of scale, with the first being a small and intimate detail, while the second is a wide and expansive scene.  They both convey a sense of wonder and beauty, but in different ways.",

            "score_4o": "2",
            "score_reason": "The concept of contrast between images is unrelated to the dual linguistic meaning of '눈' in Korean, missing the humorous phrase altogether."
