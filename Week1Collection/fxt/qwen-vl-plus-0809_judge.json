The explanation correctly identifies the cultural significance of both the Colosseum and the Vespa, similar to the standard answer. However, it misses connecting both specifically to Rome, which is a key point in the standard answer."

        "score_4o": "4",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output is exactly correct and consistent in meaning with the standard answer. It accurately identifies the relationship as 'Istanbul' and explains the connection between the Hagia Sophia and Turkish Delight in relation to their common location in Istanbul."

    "Toronto(visible, city, mutual elements, NA, English)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM output addresses the connection as 'Seasonal change,' which is a broad interpretation not aligning with the standard answer of 'Toronto.' The explanation brings forth a contrast between nature and architecture but lacks relevant facts about the CN Tower's location in Toronto or the significance of maple leaves as a Canadian symbol."

    "Berlin(visible, city, mutual elements, NA, English)": {
        "score_4o": "3",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM output broadly categorizes the relationship between the Brandenburg Gate and currywurst as 'Culture,' which is related but less specific than 'Berlin.' However, the explanation provided correctly identifies both the landmark and the cultural food as significant aspects of German culture, aligning with elements in the standard answer."
    },
    "Dubai(visible, city, mutual elements, NA, English)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output describes the relationship as 'Urban vs. Natural,' which is a broad theme and doesn't address the specific connection detailed in the standard answer, namely the location of the Burj Khalifa in Dubai and the cultural significance of the falcon in the UAE. While the explanation captures the contrast between human-made structures and the natural world, it lacks the relevant cultural or geographical facts that align with the standard answer's focus on Dubai and the UAE."

        "score_4o": "4",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's response precisely aligns with the standard answer. It correctly identifies 'San Francisco' as the relation and provides an accurate and insightful explanation of both icons as landmarks of San Francisco, similar to the standard answer given."

    "Brussels(visible, city, mutual elements, NA, English)": {
        "score_4o": "3",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output correctly identifies the first image as a cultural landmark in Brussels, but it does not explicitly mention Brussels in the relation or explanation, instead describing it broadly as 'Food and Culture.' The explanation captures the cultural significance but misses the specific connection to Brussels, which is key in the standard answer. However, it does correctly associate Manneken Pis with Belgium and implies Belgian waffles' origin, giving partial correctness."

    "Bhutan(visible, country, mutual elements, NA, English)": {
        "score_4o": "3",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM correctly identifies the relationship as 'Buddhism,' which is partially consistent with the standard answer, but not as specific as 'Bhutan.' It provides an accurate explanation of the images having a Buddhist connection, but it doesn't specifically mention the Tiger's Nest Monastery or its ties to Bhutanese culture, which are key elements in the standard answer."

    "Madagascar(visible, country, mutual elements, NA, English)": {
        "score_4o": "3",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output summarizes the relationship as 'Nature,' which is a broader category than the specific connection of 'Madagascar,' as mentioned in the standard answer. However, it does recognize the key concepts of flora (Baobab tree) and fauna (lemur) that are central to the explanation of their relevance to a specific natural setting like Madagascar, aligning partly with the standard answer."

    "Mongolia(visible, country, mutual elements, NA, English)": {
        "score_4o": "3",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output gives a relation of 'Nomadic lifestyle,' which partially aligns with the standard answer 'Mongolia.' It provides an explanation related to traditional nomadic lifestyles, which involves Mongolian cultural elements like gers and horse riding. However, it doesn't directly mention 'Mongolia,' which is central to the standard answer, leading to a score of 3 for being roughly correct but incomplete."

        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM output describes the relation as 'Culture,' which is quite broad and does not capture the specific geographical connection to Nepal mentioned in the standard answer. The explanation discusses the sacred aspect of mountains and the cultural use of prayer wheels, but it lacks a specific mention of Nepal or elements that directly connect the images to this region, unlike the standard answer's more precise geographical and cultural context."

        "score_4o": "3",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM accurately establishes a connection through the concept of historical trade routes. However, it does not specifically mention 'Uzbekistan,' 'Registan Square,' or 'Samarkand,' which are key components of the standard answer. While the broad theme of trade routes is addressed, the explanation is incomplete as it lacks the specific context of Uzbekistan's significance."

        "score_reason": "The MLLM's response identifies the relation as 'Tropical,' which is broader and not directly aligned with the specific cultural connection of 'Samoa' outlined in the standard answer. While it discusses tropical themes, it doesn't mention the cultural significance of beach fales and tatau in Samoan culture, thus lacking the relevant facts from the standard answer."

        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output addresses the concept of 'Food Culture,' which is related but not specifically what the standard answer indicates. While it effectively highlights the traditional aspects of Japanese and Italian cuisine, it doesn't convey the broader theme of cultural customs as expressed by the proverb 'Every country has its customs.' It also lacks detailed reasoning about the differentiation of cultural practices."

        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output refers to 'Construction' as the relation, which is a general theme but does not capture the deeper meaning of gradual progress represented by 'Roma non fu fatta in un giorno.' The explanation focuses on construction materials without connecting to the concept of incremental effort and time, as referenced in the standard answer."

        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM output identifies the relationship as 'Nature,' which is too broad and doesn't align with the standard answer of 'A goccia a goccia si scava la pietra.' The explanation provided by the MLLM correctly identifies some similarities between the images, but it fails to capture the specific concept of 'erosion over time' conveyed in the standard answer."

        "score_4o": "3",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's reasoning connects the mathematical equations to scientific and engineering fields and the industrial machinery to manufacturing, which aligns with the standard answer's focus on planning and successful outcomes. It captures the broad idea of planning and practical application but fails to mention the specific 'measure twice, cut once' principle, resulting in a slightly less precise answer."
    },
    "Occhio non vede, cuore non duole(invisible, sense, mutual elements, Non-English European, Italian)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM output identifies the concept of 'separation,' which could loosely align with the idea of a closed door representing closure. However, it fails to capture the nuanced concept expressed in the standard answer, 'Occhio non vede, cuore non duole,' which implies ignoring or hiding a problem to avoid distress. The MLLM's mention of chaos versus order does not reflect the intended reasoning related to avoiding awareness of a problem."
    },
    "A lume di naso(invisible, sense, mutual elements, Non-English European, Italian)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output identifies the connection as 'Digging,' focusing on the physical behavior of the dogs, which is somewhat correct but lacks the deeper connection to the instinctual behavior highlighted in the standard explanation. The explanation is centered on the action of digging rather than the instinctual use of the sense of smell, as in the standard answer 'A lume di naso.' This reflects a too broad understanding without delving into relevant facts about instinct."
    },
    "Networking Event(visible, business, mutual elements, NA, English)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's response is loosely related by connecting the concept of interaction. However, it does not align closely with the standard answer's emphasis on 'Networking Event,' with the spider web symbolizing connections and the business card facilitating networking specifically. The MLLM's explanation lacks the specific context of a networking event and the metaphorical use of the spider web."
    },
    "Supply Chain(invisible, business, relation, NA, English)": {
        "score_4o": "3",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM output captures a part of the essence of the standard answer by discussing 'transportation and logistics' in relation to 'production' and 'distribution'. However, it more broadly attributes 'transportation' as the relation, rather than the more encompassing theme of 'Supply Chain' given in the standard answer, resulting in a slightly broader interpretation."
    },
    "まだな(invisible, country, relation, East Asia, Japanese)": {
        "score_4o": "0",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM includes incorrect facts in its response. It incorrectly associates bananas with time based on a dessert context and does not recognize the humorous linguistic connection conveyed by 'まだな' (mada na). Therefore, the MLLM's explanation diverges significantly from the standard answer."

    "work life(invisible, business, relation, NA, English)": {
        "score_4o": "3",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output generally captures the concept of 'balance' symbolized by a scale and harmony in a family portrait. However, it lacks specific references to 'work' and 'life,' which are part of the key facts in the standard answer's reasoning on work-life balance."

    "Longevity(invisible, country, relation, East Asia, Japanese)": {
        "score_4o": "3",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's explanation captures key aspects of each image pertaining to Japanese culture – sushi as a popular Japanese dish and cranes as symbols of good fortune, closely paralleling the concept of longevity. However, it does not explicitly bridge between sushi and longevity in its reasoning, leading to a partially correct, yet incomplete summary of the connection based on the standard answer."

    "rabbit by the sea(invisible, country, relation, East Asia, Japanese)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM output identifies 'Nature' as the relation between the images, which is too broad and does not align with the specific and whimsical connection 'rabbit by the sea' described in the standard answer. It fails to mention the playful linguistic elements present in the reasoning and focuses solely on visual aspects."
    },
    "as tight as beef(invisible, country, metaphor, East Asia, Japanese)": {
        "score_4o": "0",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM provides an explanation based on public transportation and the consumption of food while commuting, which is not related to the standard answer. Moreover, it contains incorrect facts by assuming a connection that does not exist in the standard answer's context. The standard answer involves a linguistic pun between 'Gyūniku' (beef) and 'Gyūgyū' (crowded), which the MLLM fails to capture, leading to a factuality hallucination in its explanation."
    },
    "the cat is evidence(invisible, country, relation, East Asia, Japanese)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output labeled the relation as 'Investigation,' which doesn't align with the standard answer 'the cat is evidence.' The explanation involves logical reasoning about investigation processes, missing the humorous linguistic association described in the standard answer. However, the notion of a cat being related to evidence is present, albeit in a different context."

    "work is killing me(invisible, country, relation, East Asia, Japanese)": {
        "score_4o": "3",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output relates 'Death' to the stress of work possibly leading to burnout, which aligns with the concept of 'work is killing me.' However, it does not capture the phonetic play between 'shigoto' and 'shikyo' from the standard answer, resulting in a less precise explanation."

    "Vorrei del pane, ma non del pene(invisible, country, relation, Non-English European, Italian)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM output provides a connection as 'Food and Fun,' which is excessively broad and not directly related to the given explanation. The concept of enjoying bread, linked to happiness, is a creative interpretation but misses the more nuanced comedic relation explained in the standard answer involving a pun on Italian words. The reasoning fails to align with the specific language-based humor described in the standard answer."
    },
    "Need some salve(invisible, country, metaphor, Non-English European, Italian)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM connects the two images through a broad theme of 'care and interaction,' which is not directly related to the standard answer. The standard explanation is more focused on the linguistic play on the word 'salve,' which serves as both a greeting and an ointment in Italian, creating a humorous link between the images. The MLLM's explanation did not address this play on words, resulting in a less precise connection with the standard reasoning."
    },
    "My dog is more like a stick(invisible, country, metaphor, Non-English European, Italian)": {
        "score_4o": "1",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output identifies a relation of 'Resting,' but this does not align with the humorous wordplay explained in the standard answer, which involves the Italian word 'cane' having meanings for both 'dog' and 'stick.' The output also contains a misinterpretation of the use of a cane, unrelated to the intended joke about the dog's laziness. However, it provides an attempt at reasoning that acknowledges these elements in some form, even though it is not consistent with the intended meaning."

    "Can't find the needle(invisible, country, relation, Non-English European, Italian)": {
        "score_4o": "1",

    "Ho visto del vino e ho bevuto(invisible, country, metaphor, Non-English European, Italian)": {
        "score_4o": "1",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM output identifies no explicit connection between the two images, which indicates a lack of recognition of the playful linguistic connection based on the dual meaning of 'vino.' As the MLLM expresses certainty by stating 'There is no apparent connection,' it clearly shows that the intended wordplay and cultural understanding present in the standard answer were missed."
    },
    "Sole(invisible, country, relation, Non-English European, Italian)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output identifies a broad theme of 'Romance,' which is somewhat related but lacks specific reference to the concept of the dual meaning of 'sole' in Italian, as outlined in the standard answer. The explanation focuses on general romantic imagery rather than the linguistic humor and affection expressed in the standard reasoning."
    },
    "Filo(invisible, country, metaphor, Non-English European, Italian)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM output identifies a common theme between the images, which is 'Connection,' linking the use of threads and wires for sewing and electrical purposes. However, it does not capture the specific humorous linguistic connection related to the Italian word 'filo' as described in the standard answer. The interpretation remains too broad and lacks specificity about the cultural or linguistic insight present in the standard reasoning."

        "score_4o": "0",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM output incorrectly claims that kimchi is often used to relieve coughs, which is a factual inaccuracy in relation to the given context. Instead of providing an explanation that aligns with the playful and humorous connection between '김치' and '기침' as outlined in the standard answer, the MLLM provides an incorrect and misleading relation and explanation."

    "apple and accident(invisible, country, relation, East Asia, Korean)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM output identifies a broad thematic contrast between 'safety and danger,' which is valid at a superficial level, but it does not align with the deeper, linguistic connection in the standard answer. The standard answer provides a cultural context and wordplay involving the Korean words for 'apple' and 'accident,' which the MLLM misses entirely."

It fails to recognize the linguistic connection between 'stomach' and 'boat' in Korean, which is the key to the standard answer. Thus, the score reflects a lack of understanding of the provided relation."

    "Because this is the world(invisible, country, relation, East Asia, Korean)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output describes the relationship as 'Time and space,' which is a broad interpretation that does not directly align with the standard answer 'Because this is the world.' While it mentions concepts related to time and space, it lacks the cultural and linguistic connection explained in the standard answer about the Korean word '세상' and its dual meanings of 'world' and 'age.'"
    },
    "snow and eyes(invisible, country, relation, East Asia, Korean)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's response identifies the images as representing 'nature,' focusing on human anatomy and a winter landscape, tying them to natural elements. However, it fails to connect this interpretation to the specific linguistic wordplay relationship highlighted in the standard answer, pertaining to the Korean word '눈' (meaning both 'eye' and 'snow'). Consequently, while the MLLM's response is broadly related to nature, it does not capture the subtleties of the language connection present in the standard answer."
