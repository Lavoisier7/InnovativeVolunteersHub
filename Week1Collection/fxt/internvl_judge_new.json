        "score_4o": "1",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's illustration of bread lacks the clever Italian wordplay on 'bread' and 'pene' and shows no link to the standard answer's humor, offering a mostly literal interpretation instead."

        "score_4o": "1",
        "score_reason": "Although touching on themes of well-being, the MLLM misses the linguistic dual interpretation indicated in the standard answer and does not convey the intended humorous connection with 'salve'."

        "score_4o": "1",

        "score_4o": "1",

        "score_4o": "1",
