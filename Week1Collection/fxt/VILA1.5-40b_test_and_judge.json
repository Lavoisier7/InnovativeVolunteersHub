The second image illustrates the concept of searching for a target audience, which is a crucial step in advertising. The two images are related because billboards are a way to reach a target audience through advertising.\nBillboards are large, outdoor advertising structures that are typically mounted on a pole or building. They are used to display advertisements to a wide audience, and are often located in high-traffic areas such as highways, city streets, and shopping centers. The second image shows a search for a target audience, which is the process of identifying and reaching out to the specific group of people that are most likely to be interested in a product or service. This is an important step in advertising because it helps advertisers to focus their efforts on the people who are most likely to be interested in their product or service, and to avoid wasting money on advertising to people who are not interested.",
