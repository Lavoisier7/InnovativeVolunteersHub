        "MLLM_answer": "First image: Thread spool with a needle\nSecond image: Hand holding multiple colored wires\nRelation: Connection\nExplanation: Both images involve threads/wires being used for sewing or electrical purposes. The first image shows a thread spool with a needle, which is commonly used in sewing. The second image shows a hand holding various colored wires, which are typically used in electrical wiring. The connection between the two images lies in their common use in crafting or construction activities.",

            "score_4o": "2",
            "score_reason": "The MLLM output identifies a common theme between the images, which is 'Connection,' linking the use of threads and wires for sewing and electrical purposes. However, it does not capture the specific humorous linguistic connection related to the Italian word 'filo' as described in the standard answer. The interpretation remains too broad and lacks specificity about the cultural or linguistic insight present in the standard reasoning."

        "MLLM_answer": "First image: Kimchi in a glass container\nSecond image: Man coughinging into his hand\nRelation: Coughinging\nExplanation: The first image shows kimchi, which is often used to relieve coughs. The second image shows a man who appears to be coughinginging, possibly indicating that he may have a cold or other some other ailment that requires relief from coughinging.",

            "score_reason": "The MLLM output incorrectly claims that kimchi is often used to relieve coughs, which is a factual inaccuracy in relation to the given context. Instead of providing an explanation that aligns with the playful and humorous connection between '김치' and '기침' as outlined in the standard answer, the MLLM provides an incorrect and misleading relation and explanation."

            "score_reason": "The MLLM output identifies a broad thematic contrast between 'safety and danger,' which is valid at a superficial level, but it does not align with the deeper, linguistic connection in the standard answer. The standard answer provides a cultural context and wordplay involving the Korean words for 'apple' and 'accident,' which the MLLM misses entirely."

        "MLLM_answer": "First image: Woman experiencing stomach pain\nSecond image: Red boat on water\nRelation: None\nExplanation: The two images are unrelated. The first image shows a woman in distress due to stomach pain, while the second image depicts a red boat floating on water with an American flag. There is no apparent connection between the two scenes.",
        "judge_answer": {
            "score_4o": "1",
            "score_reason": "The MLLM responds with 'None' as the relationship between the images, indicating there is no apparent connection. It fails to recognize the linguistic connection between 'stomach' and 'boat' in Korean, which is the key to the standard answer. Thus, the score reflects a lack of understanding of the provided relation."

The second image shows a hand holding an old, disintegrating clock, representing the passage of time and the fleeting nature of time. Both images relate to the concepts of time and space, with the first focusing on the vastness of the world and the second highlighting the transience of life.",

        "MLLM_answer": "First image: Close-up of an eye\nSecond image: Snow-covered trees in a forest\nRelation: Nature\nExplanation: Both images depict natural elements; the first one focuses on human anatomy (the eye), while the second one showcases a winter landscape with snow.",
        "judge_answer": {
            "score_4o": "2",
            "score_reason": "The MLLM's response identifies the images as representing 'nature,' focusing on human anatomy and a winter landscape, tying them to natural elements. However, it fails to connect this interpretation to the specific linguistic wordplay relationship highlighted in the standard answer, pertaining to the Korean word '눈' (meaning both 'eye' and 'snow'). Consequently, while the MLLM's response is broadly related to nature, it does not capture the subtleties of the language connection present in the standard answer."
