        "MLLM_answer": "- First image: Young girl performing aerial silks routine\n- Second image: Silver horseshoe charm with \"Good Luck\" engraved \n- Relation: **Wishing for good luck**\n- Explanation: The horseshoe is a symbol of good luck, and it's common to wish performers \"good luck\" before a show or performance. The image of the aerial silks performer, coupled with the horseshoe charm, suggests a connection between performance and the hope for a successful outcome. \n",

            "score_reason": "The explanation effectively aligns with the standard answer in illustrating the connection between performing risks and luck, related to 'Hals- und Beinbruch.' It captures the theme of wishing good luck to performers similar to the idiom."

        "MLLM_answer": "- First image: An ostrich running in a savanna-like environment\n- Second image: Rolling dunes of sand in a desert\n- Relation: **Habitat**\n- Explanation: Ostriches are large flightless birds known for inhabiting savannas, grasslands, and deserts, particularly in Africa. The second image depicts a desert environment, a possible habitat for an ostrich. \n",
        "judge_answer": {
            "score_4o": "2",
            "score_reason": "The explanation of habitat is too literal and does not address the idiomatic expression 'Kopf in den Sand stecken,' which explores themes of denial and avoidance. The standard answer focuses on this metaphorical context, which the MLLM neglects."
