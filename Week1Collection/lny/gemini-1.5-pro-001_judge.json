        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output mentions 'generations,' which is somewhat relevant to the theme of 'Cien años de soledad,' but lacks depth in terms of the specific novel's elements like the Buendía family and Macondo. It does not summarize or relate key themes and insights discussed in the standard answer."
    },
    "La Casa de los Espíritus(invisible, art, relation, Latin American, Spanish)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's explanation focuses on 'supernatural mystery,' which is too broad and doesn't connect to the specific narrative of 'La Casa de los Espíritus.' It lacks mention of themes like the intertwining of family, politics, and the supernatural within a haunted mansion that are central to the novel."
    },
    "El amor en los tiempos del cólera(invisible, art, relation, Latin American, Spanish)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The explanation of 'invisible threats' is overly broad and doesn't capture the key elements of 'El amor en los tiempos del cólera,' such as love enduring through the cholera epidemic and the love letters, which are central themes in the novel."
    },
    "La sombra del viento(invisible, art, relation, Latin American, Spanish)": {
        "score_4o": "3",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM captures the theme of a 'journey of discovery,' which aligns with the narrative and exploration aspects of 'La sombra del viento.' However, it could be more precise by directly mentioning the mysterious journey undertaken by the protagonist concerning the book in the novel."
    },
    "Pedro Páramo(invisible, art, relation, Latin American, Spanish)": {
        "score_4o": "3",
        "score_reason": "The explanation discusses 'ghost town,' partially aligning with the theme of 'Pedro Páramo' and the concept of Comala filled with the spirits. This is a reasonable interpretation related to the setting and overarching themes, though it could have better incorporated explicit details about the storyline."
    },
    "¡Es un pez gordo(invisible, art, relation, Latin American, Spanish)": {
        "score_4o": "3",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM describes 'scale and perspective,' capturing part of the metaphor of influence and power in the context of a 'big fish.' This corresponds to the idiom '¡Es un pez gordo!' but doesn't fully address the figurative meaning tied to corporate or powerful figures as closely as the standard answer."
    },
    "Dar en el clavo(invisible, art, relation, Latin American, Spanish)": {
        "score_4o": "4",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM output effectively discusses 'precision and focus,' matching the idiom 'dar en el clavo' by highlighting the emphasis on precision akin to hitting the mark or achieving a specific goal, aligning well with the standard answer's interpretation."
    },
    "Echar leña al fuego(invisible, art, relation, Latin American, Spanish)": {
        "score_4o": "4",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM output about 'fueling the fire' captures the idiom 'echar leña al fuego' accurately, representing the concept of escalating conflict. It aligns well with the explanation provided in the standard answer about worsening situations."

    "Pedir peras al olmo(invisible, art, relation, Latin American, Spanish)": {
        "score_4o": "3",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM addresses 'resource and product,' which aligns with the transformation from natural resources to human-made products. However, it doesn't fully capture the idea of unrealistic demands suggested by 'pedir peras al olmo.' It misses the perspective of unachievable expectations which provides a deeper understanding of the standard answer."
    },
    "Faust(invisible, art, relation, Latin American, German)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The explanation given by the MLLM focuses on 'time and growth,' which is overly broad and misses the specific thematic elements related to 'Faust,' such as temptation and the passage of time as symbolic influences in the narrative."

    "Die Verwandlung(invisible, art, relation, Latin American, German)": {
        "score_4o": "3",
        "score_reason": "The explanation given by the MLLM connects the ladybug as a representation of 'fleeting time,' partially overlapping with Gregor Samsa's transformation in 'Die Verwandlung' regarding time disruption. While it aligns with the symbol of temporality, it lacks direct reference to the themes of alienation and metamorphosis presented in the standard answer."
    },
    "Die Räuber(invisible, art, relation, Latin American, German)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The explanation discusses a 'broken legacy' related to the Confederate flag and shattered glass but does not align with the thematic focus of 'Die Räuber,' such as rebellion and fractured identity. It misses key themes present in the play."

    "Der Steppenwolf(invisible, art, relation, Latin American, German)": {
        "score_4o": "3",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM discusses the representation of wolves which partially overlaps with 'Der Steppenwolf,' notably the untamed aspect of humanity. The explanation shows understanding of thematic symbolism but does not explicitly mention identity duality as connected to the standard answer."

        "score_4o": "2",

    "Die Katze im Sack kaufen(invisible, art, relation, Latin American, German)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The explanation focuses on 'curiosity,' which is broadly relevant but does not encapsulate the idiomatic expression 'Die Katze im Sack kaufen,' nor does it elaborate on the core thematic representation of unexpected consequences as suggested by the standard answer."
    },
    "Hals- und Beinbruch(invisible, art, relation, Latin American, German)": {
        "score_4o": "4",
        "score_reason": "The explanation effectively aligns with the standard answer in illustrating the connection between performing risks and luck, related to 'Hals- und Beinbruch.' It captures the theme of wishing good luck to performers similar to the idiom."

    "Kopf in den Sand stecken(invisible, art, relation, Latin American, German)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The explanation of habitat is too literal and does not address the idiomatic expression 'Kopf in den Sand stecken,' which explores themes of denial and avoidance. The standard answer focuses on this metaphorical context, which the MLLM neglects."
