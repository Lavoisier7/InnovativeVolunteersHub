    "Pedro Páramo(invisible, art, relation, Latin American, Spanish)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM captures a general supernatural theme but lacks the literary-specific connections to 'Pedro Páramo'. It fails to note the context of spirits and the town of Comala integral to the novel."
    },
    "¡Es un pez gordo(invisible, art, relation, Latin American, Spanish)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The response mentions 'fishing' but misses the metaphorical connotations of power as a 'big fish', related to '¡Es un pez gordo!'. It broadly interprets 'fishing' instead of the narrative's business-world symbolism."
    },
    "Dar en el clavo(invisible, art, relation, Latin American, Spanish)": {
        "score_4o": "3",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM identifies precision and accuracy in both images similarly to the idiom 'Dar en el clavo', but falls short in explicitly connecting to the idiomatic expression or giving the phrase's meaning."
    },
    "Echar leña al fuego(invisible, art, relation, Latin American, Spanish)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's response broadly describes communication and interaction, failing to discuss the metaphorical relevance of escalation and conflict, which is critical to 'Echar leña al fuego'."
    },
    "Pedir peras al olmo(invisible, art, relation, Latin American, Spanish)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's interpretation of natural themes is broad and lacks the specific connections to unrealistic expectations symbolized by the idiom 'Pedir peras al olmo'."
    },
    "Faust(invisible, art, relation, Latin American, German)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM focuses on color differentiation without addressing the literary themes of temptation and time in 'Faust'. It fails to capture the narrative symbolism the images contain."
    },
    "Der Prozess(invisible, art, relation, Latin American, German)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The response mentions complexity but lacks literary alignment with 'Der Prozess'. It doesn't connect the typewriter and labyrinth to the novel’s themes of bureaucracy and legal convolution."
    },
    "Die Verwandlung(invisible, art, relation, Latin American, German)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The explanation offers a broad metaphor for time but fails to align with the specific themes of transformation and alienation in 'Die Verwandlung'. It lacks the literary context critical to Kafka's work."
    },
    "Die Räuber(invisible, art, relation, Latin American, German)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The idea of 'break' is overly broad and misses the specific themes in 'Die Räuber' related to rebellion and fractured identities. It significantly lacks the depth needed for coherence with the standard answer."
    },
    "Der Steppenwolf(invisible, art, relation, Latin American, German)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The explanation relates to masks in general but lacks the depth to connect to 'Der Steppenwolf'. It misses themes of duality and identity conflict central to the novel."
    },
    "Nibelungenlied(invisible, art, relation, Latin American, German)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "Identifying mythical creatures contrasts lacks the depth to tie into 'Nibelungenlied'. The MLLM's explanation doesn’t capture thematic elements of heroic quests and greed around Siegfried's narrative."
    },
    "Ich verstehe nur Bahnhof(invisible, art, relation, Latin American, German)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The explanation touches on cultural interconnection but lacks a literary-specific angle tied to 'Ich verstehe nur Bahnhof', missing the theme of misunderstanding and complexity represented."
    },
    "Die Katze im Sack kaufen(invisible, art, relation, Latin American, German)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM describes shared backgrounds but doesn't discuss the idiom 'Die Katze im Sack kaufen'. Lacks exploration of hidden risks or outcomes within the imagery context needed for the literature."
    },
    "Hals- und Beinbruch(invisible, art, relation, Latin American, German)": {
        "score_4o": "3",
        "score_reason": "The explanation involves elements of performance and luck that align with 'Hals- und Beinbruch', reflecting both ideas reasonably well. It aligns more with the standard answer than not."
    },
    "Kopf in den Sand stecken(invisible, art, relation, Latin American, German)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "Identifies natural environments broadly but fails to delve into literary symbolic meanings like 'Kopf in den Sand stecken'. Overview lacks tie to narrative aspects of denial presented in standard answer."
