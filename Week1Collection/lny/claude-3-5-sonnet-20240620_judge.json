        "score_4o": "3",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output correctly focuses on precision and accuracy but misses the idiomatic expression 'Dar en el clavo' directly. It effectively captures the main idea but does not explicitly tie it back to the idiom, which is the missing key insight."

    "Echar leña al fuego(invisible, art, relation, Latin American, Spanish)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The explanation captures the sense of pressure but fails to effectively connect it to the expression 'echar leña al fuego,' missing the insight of escalating conflict described in the standard answer, showing only a partial understanding."
    },
    "Pedir peras al olmo(invisible, art, relation, Latin American, Spanish)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "Though it describes the natural origin of materials, the MLLM misses the idiomatic point 'Pedir peras al olmo' regarding expectations from unnatural sources, which is crucial to the standard reasoning. It interprets the images more broadly without aligning with the idiomatic inference."
    },
    "Faust(invisible, art, relation, Latin American, German)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "While the MLLM notes freshness and time elements, it doesn't connect these metaphors to the novel 'Faust,' particularly the themes of temptation and time as key insights, which are central to the standard answer."
    },
    "Der Prozess(invisible, art, relation, Latin American, German)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM identifies pathways and expression but doesn't align with 'Der Prozess.' It lacks critical elements about the legal system and bureaucratic themes in Kafka's work, which are essential insights in the standard answer."

        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM output touches on natural and artifice themes but doesn't relate these accurately to the existential and temporal disruption in 'Die Verwandlung.' It captures broader themes without the intended focus on Kafka's narrative explored in the standard answer."
    },
    "Die Räuber(invisible, art, relation, Latin American, German)": {
        "score_4o": "1",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM expresses uncertainty and does not attempt any meaningful connection between the images similar to the standard answer, showing a complete lack of alignment with the specific reasoning expected."
    },
    "Der Steppenwolf(invisible, art, relation, Latin American, German)": {
        "score_4o": "3",
        "score_reason": "The output notes transformation themes but only partially connects them with 'Der Steppenwolf.' It mentions duality and raw nature, aligning with some elements from Hesse's work, though it doesn't delve into the specific internal struggles depicted in the novel, missing depth."
    },
    "Nibelungenlied(invisible, art, relation, Latin American, German)": {
        "score_4o": "1",
        "score_reason": "MLLM Output provides no analysis of the images related to the standard reasoning, demonstrating uncertainty and hesitation without any thematic exploration connecting to 'Nibelungenlied.'"

    "Ich verstehe nur Bahnhof(invisible, art, relation, Latin American, German)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "Although MLLM explains learning process through assembling pieces, it does not effectively correlate this to the expression 'Ich verstehe nur Bahnhof.' It lacks relevant insights indicating a theme of confusion or misunderstanding, critical to the standard answer."

        "score_4o": "3",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM output demonstrates a thematic link of surprise and alertness, almost mapping the idiom 'Die Katze im Sack kaufen.' While it touches upon potential surprise, it lacks the idiomatic expression embodying the unknown risks, slightly missing the nuanced conclusion."

    "Hals- und Beinbruch(invisible, art, relation, Latin American, German)": {
        "score_4o": "1",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM abstains from providing an analysis or drawing connections, offering no insight or alignment with the 'Hals- und Beinbruch' explanation, indicating a complete lack of engagement with the imagery."

    "Kopf in den Sand stecken(invisible, art, relation, Latin American, German)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The response captures arid landscapes but misses the thematic depth of the idiom 'Kopf in den Sand stecken.' It covers surface-level environmental adaptations without connecting them to themes of avoidance of reality noted in the standard explanation."
