The second image, on the other hand, showcases a glamorous fashion doll, embodying ideals of beauty and style.

However, the explanation about the fox is different from the standard answer; the standard answer focuses on the Kitsune, a mythical creature that can have up to nine tails, whereas the MLLM describes the tail as resembling the number nine, emphasizing a visual similarity rather than the specific cultural reference.

    "Scorpio is opposite to Taurus(invisible, myth, mutual elements, Non-English European, English)": {
        "MLLM_answer": "- First image: Scorpion\n- Second image: Book cover\n- Relation: Contrast\n- Explanation: The first image depicts a scorpion, a symbol of danger and mystery. The second image is a book cover with a serene and historical atmosphere, representing a narrative that is likely rich in story and culture. The contrast between the two images lies in the themes they represent: the primal fear and survival instincts symbolized by the scorpion, versus the intellectual curiosity and exploration of history or romance suggested by the book cover.",

            "score_4o": "2",
            "score_reason": "The MLLM's output identifies a 'Contrast' between the images. However, it does not mention the key astrological relationship between Scorpio and Taurus, which is central to the standard answer. Although it correctly identifies a symbol associated with the scorpion, the explanation is too broad and lacks facts aligning with the zodiac theme highlighted in the standard answer."

        "MLLM_answer": "- First image: [Cartoon of Red Fish]\n- Second image: [Calendar with August and September]\n- Relation: [Fish and Calendar]\n- Explanation: The first image shows a stylized illustration of two red fish, while the second image is a calendar covering the months of August and September. A possible connection between the two images could be the use of the color red in both the fish and some elements of the calendar, such as the dates or decorative elements around the calendar. Additionally, the fish could symbolically represent time passing or the flow of time, which relates to the concept of a calendar tracking dates and months.",
        "judge_answer": {

            "score_reason": "The MLLM's output provides a broad and unrelated explanation that does not align with the specific astrological connection described in the standard answer. The mention of 'red color' and 'time passing or the flow of time' does not correspond to the reasoning or symbols of Pisces and Virgo. The relation 'Fish and Calendar' does not capture the specific astrological relationship between Pisces and Virgo."

        "MLLM_answer": "- First image: Hunting scene at sunset\n- Second image: Scorpion on a white background\n- Relation: Predatory nature\n- Explanation: Both images depict creatures engaged in hunting or predatory behavior. The first image shows a human hunter and a dog at sunset, likely tracking or preparing to shoot a target, while the second image features a scorpion, a natural predator, poised on a white background. Despite the difference in species and context, the common theme of predation connects the two images.",

            "score_4o": "2",
            "score_reason": "The MLLM's output identifies the common theme as 'Predatory nature,' which is too general and does not align with the specific mythological connection described in the standard answer. The reasoning in the standard answer connects the images through the story of Orion, a hunter killed by a scorpion. The MLLM output does not mention these relevant facts and instead focuses on a general theme of predation."

        "MLLM_answer": "- First image: A warrior on a horse\n- Second image: A calendar\n- Relation: Time and theme\n- Explanation: The first image portrays a historical or fantasy-themed scene with a warrior and a horse, evoking a sense of adventure or battle. The second image presents a calendar for May and June 2024, which is a representation of time and scheduling. The relation between the two images could be seen in the theme of time, where the first image might represent a specific historical time period or a timeless adventure, and the second image serves as a reminder of the present-day scheduling and the passage of time. Both images, while seemingly unrelated in content, share the common element of time - one through the depiction of a historical moment and the other through the modern representation of dates and months.",
        "judge_answer": {

            "score_reason": "The MLLM's answer does not directly address the astrological connection between Sagittarius and Gemini, which is central to the standard answer. Instead, it focuses on the theme of time between a historical depiction and modern scheduling. While the concept of time is somewhat related, it does not align with the standard answer's emphasis on zodiac signs and their oppositions. The response is too broad and lacks specific relevant facts from the standard answer."

The second image shows the months of November and December in a calendar format, representing the passage of time. The connection between the two images could be interpreted as the idea that the warrior woman's adventures occur over a span of time, as marked by the calendar months, hinting at a narrative that unfolds over time.",

The second image is a calendar showing the months of September and October in 2023. The relation between the two images could be understood as the passage of time (October follows September) and the presence of nature (the mountain goat represents wildlife). Both images are connected by the concept of time and the natural world, even though they depict different subjects.",

In contrast, the second image shows a realistic and detailed depiction of a rooster with vibrant colors and sharp details, representing reality and natural beauty. The relation between the two images lies in their representation of creatures, one fictional and the other factual, both depicted with striking and artistic qualities.",
