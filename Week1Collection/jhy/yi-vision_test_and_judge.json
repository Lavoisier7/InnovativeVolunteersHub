The flag of Singapore contains a green field with a white crescent and five stars forming a circle, while Brazil's flag has a green field with a large yellow diamond and a blue globe with white stars.

The second image displays a human hand holding two rubber bands taut between the thumb and forefinger. The relation between the two images could be the pose of the character and the action of holding the rubber bands.

The biplane may have been used during World War I or II, while the tank likely saw action in World War II or later conflicts.
