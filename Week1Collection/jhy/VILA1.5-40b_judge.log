However, the standard answer involves a historical connection between microwave ovens and missiles, both invented during World War II.

The explanation aligns with the visual aspect of fire in the images but misses the deeper reasoning connected to East Asian folklore and thematic linkage between the Nine-Tailed Fox entities in both Naruto and Pokémon.
