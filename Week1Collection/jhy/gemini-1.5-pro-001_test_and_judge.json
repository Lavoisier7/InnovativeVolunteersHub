            "score_4o": "2",

    "Newton's discovery of universal gravitation(invisible, STEM, metaphor, NA, English)": {
        "MLLM_answer": "- First image: Apple Inc. logo\n- Second image: Earth and Moon in space\n- Relation: **Gravitation**\n- Explanation: Both images, though seemingly disparate, can be linked by the concept of gravitation. The Apple logo, with its iconic bite, can be interpreted as a playful nod to gravity and its effect on a falling object. The second image explicitly depicts the Earth and Moon, celestial bodies bound together by the force of gravity, which dictates their orbits. \n",

            "score_4o": "3",
            "score_reason": "The MLLM focuses on a conceptual relation of 'gravitation,' somewhat matching the Newtonian themes of apples and celestial orbits, but lacks deeper clarity on Newton's narrative."

            "score_4o": "3",
