The salt shaker is an essential kitchen tool used during the cooking and serving process to add or adjust the saltiness of food. In contrast, the image of the glass bowl full of pretzels indicates a snack that is often paired with drinks especially during social gatherings.

The presence of the awning indicates a city or urban setting, where the focus is on human interactions and structures.\n\nOn the other hand, the second image shows a small gray bird in its natural habitat.
