    "Tea Ceremony(culture, relation, East Asia, English)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output correctly identifies and focuses on 'matcha powder,' which is visually present in both images. However, it does not establish or mention any connection to the 'Tea Ceremony' or 'Cherry Blossoms,' which are central to the standard answer. The response is too narrow, missing the broader cultural context of the images linked to the Japanese tea ceremony."
    },
    "Wedding Traditions(culture, mutual elements, Non-English European, English)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's response identifies the relationship as 'Jewelry,' capturing a broad and general connection but failing to recognize the more specific cultural or traditional theme tied to weddings. Additionally, the explanation revolves around the similarity of the rings, missing the aspect of wedding traditions highlighted in the standard answer. While it correctly describes some elements seen in the images, it doesn't address the actual intended reasoning or theme of 'Wedding Traditions.'"
    },
    "Funeral Rites(culture, mutual elements, Non-English European, English)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM output identifies the first image as a coffin, which is a key element in the standard answer. However, it fails to grasp the broader theme of 'Funeral Rites' and does not mention any association with funerals or black clothing, as highlighted in the standard answer. Thus, the explanation is too narrow and not aligned with the intended reasoning."
    },
    "Coming-of-Age Rituals(culture, relation, Non-English European, English)": {
        "score_4o": "0",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output incorrectly states that both images are of 'a black graduation cap with a gold tassel,' when there is a factual mismatch with the standard answer referring to a 'Quincea√±era dress.' The explanation also fails to address the correct thematic concept, which is 'Coming-of-Age Rituals,' instead of stating they are 'identical,' highlighting a factual error in identifying the image content."
    },
    "Harvest Festivals(culture, mutual elements, Non-English European, English)": {
        "score_4o": "0",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's description of both images as a pile of fruits and vegetables is incorrect and does not relate to the standard answer's theme of 'Harvest Festivals' and symbols associated with it, such as 'Cornucopia' and 'Pumpkin.' The MLLM response fails to identify these key symbols and thus provides an inaccurate explanation."
    },
    "Traditional Music(culture, mutual elements, Non-English European, English)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output identifies the relation as 'The same object,' which is correct in the context of the images but does not align with the thematic connection of 'Traditional Music' provided in the standard answer. The explanation focuses purely on the visual similarity and does not consider the potential thematic link to traditional music."
    },
    "Folk Dance(culture, relation, Non-English European, English)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's response describes the images only as 'Shoes on a wooden floor,' which is too broad and fails to capture the connection to 'Folk Dance,' as outlined in the standard answer. It does not address or align with the intended reasoning related to footwear and dance. However, it doesn't include erroneous information; it just lacks depth in explanation."
    },
    "National Dress(culture, relation, Non-English European, English)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output provides a generalized connection, 'Both men are wearing a jacket,' which is unrelated to the specific 'National Dress' relationship found in the standard answer. Additionally, the explanation focuses on the shared clothing item, missing any connection to Scottish or German national dress, as indicated in the standard answer."
    },
    "Cultural Etiquette(culture, relation, Non-English European, English)": {
        "score_4o": "1",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's response focuses on the physical depiction of hands with 'shake hands' and 'holding hands,' indicating a lack of understanding or insight into the cultural etiquette context implied by the images. This suggests that the MLLM only comprehends a basic visual interpretation, not the cultural nuances specified in the standard answer."
    },
    "Taboo Subjects(culture, relation, Non-English European, English)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output connects 'censorship' to both images, which is somewhat related to the standard answer. However, the explanation provided doesn't capture the specific connection between 'censoring' speech bubbles and 'taboo subjects.' The MLLM focuses more on the general concept of censorship rather than the specific theme of taboo subjects mentioned in the standard answer. It misses the cultural association of broken mirrors with taboo, only discussing censoring in the context of AI interactions."
    },
    "Body Language(culture, relation, NA, English)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output, which focuses on the woman's posture, notices a broad theme of 'Body Language,' similar to the standard answer. However, it doesn't specifically address the meanings attributed to crossed arms or other relevant facts mentioned in the standard reasoning."

    "Oktoberfest(culture, mutual elements, Non-English European, English)": {
        "score_4o": "0",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM output misinterprets the images and their connection. The response incorrectly identifies them as simply 'ceramic containers,' failing to reference the accurate cultural and thematic link to 'Oktoberfest' associated with beer steins and dirndl dresses. It also lacks any mention of the traditional elements crucial to understanding the connection to Oktoberfest, demonstrating factual inaccuracies in its explanation."

    "Hollywood  Walk of Fame star(culture, relation, NA, English)": {
        "score_4o": "0",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's response is incorrect as it asserts that both images depict identical scenes of the Hollywood sign, without mentioning the Walk of Fame, which is a key element of the second image in the standard answer. Consequently, it does not address the intended reasoning related to the entertainment industry."
    },
    "Fourth of July  Fireworks(culture, relation, USAEnglish, English)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM output correctly identifies that the first image is the flag of the United States, which is related to the standard answer. However, it misses the connection with fireworks and their association with the Fourth of July, a key part of the standard explanation.

        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's response focuses on the theme of technology, which is not related to the standard answer about TLDR as a summary of a long article. The explanation provided does not align with the concept of summarization associated with TLDR. However, it is not completely unrelated, as technology could potentially be a context of using TLDR, but it's too broad and doesn't include any relevant facts regarding the standard answer."

    "Baseball  Hotdog(culture, relation, USAEnglish, English)": {
        "score_4o": "1",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output states the relation as 'The same,' focusing only on the visible similarity between the two images of brown baseball gloves, rather than addressing the thematic or contextual connection such as 'Baseball' as stated in the standard answer.

        "score_4o": "0",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output incorrectly interprets the images as two identical paintings of a woman with long hair and a brown dress. There is no mention or explanation related to the 'Sfumato technique' or the Mona Lisa, which are central to the standard answer. Therefore, it contains erroneous information regarding the relationship between the images."

    "A melting clock  A dream sequence in a film(culture, relation, NA, English)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output describes the images as depicting 'Time' and explains them in terms of the fluid nature of time through Salvador Dali's surrealist style. While the melting clock is indeed a representation of surrealism and time, the MLLM misses the direct connection to 'dreams' as highlighted in the standard answer, which is a key aspect of understanding Dali's work and surrealism. Therefore, the MLLM's response is too broad and fails to address the specific reasoning in the standard answer."

        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM output accurately identifies that the images depict women wearing hats, which is a factual observation. However, it does not relate these images to 'Picasso's Cubist style,' which is the intended relation in the standard answer. The MLLM fails to mention any facts related to Picasso or Cubism, providing an explanation that is too broad and not aligned with the intended standard reasoning."

    "Ink brush  A character in kanji or hanja(art, relation, East Asia, English)": {
        "score_4o": "0",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output describes the images as 'a group of pens on a white background,' repeated multiple times, and characterizes their relationship as 'the same,' focusing on the identically described content of the two images. However, this response is inconsistent with the standard answer, which discusses 'calligraphy tools' such as 'ink brushes' used in 'East Asian calligraphy.' The MLLM incorrectly identifies the objects as 'pens,' leading to a factual hallucination."
