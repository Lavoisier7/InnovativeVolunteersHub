The second image, while not explicitly about censorship, can be interpreted as a metaphor for distortion or fragmentation, which can be related to the concept of censorship as it often involves altering or breaking down the original message or truth. The broken mirror could symbolize how information or perspectives are fractured and obscured when subjected to censorship.",
