The coffin, a stark symbol of death, contrasts with the vibrant display of individuality and style in the fashion image. This juxtaposition suggests a connection between our fleeting existence and the desire to leave a mark, express ourselves, and be remembered. \n",

The distorted clock in Dali's work plays with the concept of time, while the oversized, pink moon juxtaposed with the familiar landscape of the waterfall creates a dreamlike and unreal atmosphere.
