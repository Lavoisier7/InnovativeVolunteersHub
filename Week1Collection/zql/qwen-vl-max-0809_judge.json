    "Tea Ceremony(culture, relation, East Asia, English)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output suggests a relation of 'Nature and purity,' which is too broad and does not specifically relate to the 'Tea Ceremony' identified in the standard answer. Although both matcha and cherry blossoms are natural, the MLLM does not mention the cultural and traditional context connecting them to the Japanese tea ceremony. Therefore, the reasoning is not aligned with the standard answer."
    },
    "Wedding Traditions(culture, mutual elements, Non-English European, English)": {
        "score_4o": "4",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output correctly identifies the relation as 'Wedding theme,' which is synonymous with 'Wedding Traditions' mentioned in the standard answer. The explanation accurately describes the significance of wedding bands and floral arrangements in the context of weddings, aligning closely with the standard reasoning provided."
    },
    "Funeral Rites(culture, mutual elements, Non-English European, English)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM describes the relationship as 'Contrast,' which is broad and not directly related to the specific relationship 'Funeral Rites' given in the standard answer. The explanation focuses on contrasts such as life versus death and modernity versus tradition but misses the specific theme of 'Funeral Rites' that ties the images together in the standard reasoning."
    },
    "Coming-of-Age Rituals(culture, relation, Non-English European, English)": {
        "score_4o": "3",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output identifies the relationship between the images as 'Celebration of milestones,' which is related but not as precise as 'Coming-of-Age Rituals.' The explanation provided is similar in theme, discussing significant life events, but differs in associating the dress directly with a prom rather than the Quincea√±era. It correctly captures the theme of personal milestones but misses specific cultural context."
    },
    "Harvest Festivals(culture, mutual elements, Non-English European, English)": {
        "score_4o": "3",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM output describes the relationship as 'Harvest theme,' which is similar to the standard answer 'Harvest Festivals.' The explanation effectively captures the idea of harvest and abundance, mentioning the cornucopia and pumpkins as symbols. However, it falls short in specifically linking these symbols to traditional harvest festivals as seen in the standard answer."
    },
    "Traditional Music(culture, mutual elements, Non-English European, English)": {
        "score_4o": "3",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output identifies the connection between the violin and bagpipes as 'Musical instruments,' which is roughly aligned with the standard answer 'Traditional Music.' However, it focuses more on the cultural backgrounds rather than their roles as traditional instruments in Western music, which makes it slightly incomplete compared to the standard explanation."
    },
    "Folk Dance(culture, relation, Non-English European, English)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's interpretation of the images focuses on 'traditional attire,' which emphasizes the depiction of cultural clothing. However, it does not connect this to 'Folk Dance' as in the standard answer. The MLLM mentions cultural significance but lacks the details on folk dance that would align with the reasoning provided in the standard answer."
    },
    "National Dress(culture, relation, Non-English European, English)": {
        "score_4o": "4",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM output accurately identifies the relation as 'Traditional clothing,' which aligns with the standard answer's focus on 'National Dress.' The explanation successfully conveys the idea that kilts and dirndls are traditional attire associated with Scottish and German cultural events, respectively, capturing the essence of cultural heritage as noted in the standard answer."
    },
    "Cultural Etiquette(culture, relation, Non-English European, English)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output describes a connection based on 'Agreement,' which is incorrect according to the standard answer. The standard answer points to 'Cultural Etiquette,' focusing on handshakes and bows as forms of greeting in different cultures. The MLLM response doesn't relate to the reasoning intended in the standard answer but provides a broad idea of mutual understanding."
    },
    "Taboo Subjects(culture, relation, Non-English European, English)": {
        "score_4o": "3",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output summarizes the relationship as 'Censorship and distortion,' which is related to the standard answer's theme of 'Taboo Subjects' through the concept of communication being suppressed or altered. However, it doesn't specifically mention taboo subjects or the cultural associations of bad luck with broken mirrors, which are key elements in the standard answer. Thus, the connection is roughly correct but incomplete."
    },
    "Body Language(culture, relation, NA, English)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output centers around the theme of 'Positive feedback or approval,' which does not explicitly align with the standard answer's focus on 'Body Language.' Although it mentions 'thumbs-up' as a sign of approval (aligning with the standard's interpretation), it misses the key aspect about crossed arms relating to body language interpretation. Therefore, it is partially correct but remains too broad, lacking the specific insights presented in the standard answer."
    },
    "Oktoberfest(culture, mutual elements, Non-English European, English)": {
        "score_4o": "3",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output identifies 'German culture' as the relationship, which is broader than the standard answer's focus on 'Oktoberfest.' However, the explanation correctly links beer steins and dirndl dresses with German traditions, similar to the connection found in the standard answer, albeit without specifically highlighting Oktoberfest."
    },
    "Hollywood  Walk of Fame star(culture, relation, NA, English)": {
        "score_4o": "3",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output identifies the relationship as 'Hollywood landmarks,' which is not exactly the same as 'entertainment industry' from the standard answer, but is related. The explanation captures the significance of both landmarks in Hollywood and mentions their connection to fame and the entertainment industry, aligning partially with the standard explanation."
    },
    "Fourth of July  Fireworks(culture, relation, USAEnglish, English)": {
        "score_4o": "3",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output describes the relationship as 'Celebration of national pride,' which is consistent with the concept of national identity but is more general than the direct 'United States' relation presented in the standard answer. The explanation captures key elements like the American flag and fireworks being associated with national pride and significant U.S. holidays such as Independence Day, aligning partially with the standard explanation but not mentioning the Fourth of July directly."
    },
    "TLDR  A very long article(culture, relation, NA, English)": {
        "score_4o": "4",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output correctly identifies the relationship as 'Information summarization,' which is synonymous with the standard answer 'Summary.' The explanation accurately describes the function of 'TL;DR' in providing a brief summary of lengthy content, mirroring the standard answer's emphasis on summarizing important points from a long text."
    },
    "Baseball  Hotdog(culture, relation, USAEnglish, English)": {
        "score_4o": "3",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output summarizes the relationship as 'Sports and food,' which is generally correct but not as precise as the standard answer, 'Baseball.' The explanation, however, aligns well with the standard answer, mentioning the association of baseball gloves and hot dogs with baseball games, as reflected in the standard answer."
    },
    "Mona Lisa  Sfumato technique description(art, relation, NA, English)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output describes the relation as 'Artistic expression,' which is too broad and does not align with the specific connection in the standard answer, which is the 'Sfumato technique description.' The explanation mentions the evocation of emotions through artistic forms, but it misses key aspects of the shared technique highlighted in the standard explanation."
    },
    "A melting clock  A dream sequence in a film(culture, relation, NA, English)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's response focuses on the common theme of 'Surrealism,' which is too broad and doesn't specifically align with the standard answer's focus on 'dream.' While it correctly describes the surrealistic nature of the images, it fails to connect this theme directly to 'dream' as explained in the standard answer."
    },
    "A Picasso portrait  Geometric shapes(art, relation, NA, English)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output identifies 'Geometric shapes' as the relation, which misses the specific connection to 'Picasso's Cubist style.' While it correctly mentions the presence of geometric shapes, it does not adequately capture the Cubist art connection or relate it to Picasso, as detailed in the standard answer."
    },
    "Ink brush  A character in kanji or hanja(art, relation, East Asia, English)": {
        "score_4o": "3",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output provides 'Language learning tools' as the relationship, which aligns with the theme of writing and understanding characters. The explanation given mentions the connection to language practice and the educational graphic on different forms of Chinese characters, which aligns slightly with the calligraphy tools but does not directly state the calligraphy aspect associated with hanzi, hanja, and kanji, as in the standard answer. Therefore, it's roughly correct but not as specific."
