    "Tea Ceremony(culture, relation, East Asia, English)": {
        "score_4o": "3",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output identifies the relationship as 'Japanese culture,' which is related but not as specific as 'Tea Ceremony,' as stated in the standard answer.

    "Wedding Traditions(culture, mutual elements, Non-English European, English)": {
        "score_4o": "4",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output accurately identifies the relationship as 'Wedding,' which is consistent in meaning with the standard answer 'Wedding Traditions.'

    },
    "Funeral Rites(culture, mutual elements, Non-English European, English)": {
        "score_4o": "3",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output identifies the relationship as 'Mourning,' which reflects a theme closely related to but broader than 'Funeral Rites.' It effectively describes the connection between the images and the concept of funerals, mentioning key facts consistent with the standard explanation. However, it lacks the context of 'Western funeral rites,' noted in the standard answer."
    },
    "Coming-of-Age Rituals(culture, relation, Non-English European, English)": {
        "score_4o": "3",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output describes the relation as 'Celebration of milestones,' which aligns closely with the standard answer 'Coming-of-Age Rituals,' but is not precisely the same. The explanation correctly mentions the significance of both the graduation cap and the quincea√±era dress in marking life milestones, similar to the standard answer, but doesn't explicitly address the common theme of 'coming-of-age' beyond general milestones."
    },
    "Harvest Festivals(culture, mutual elements, Non-English European, English)": {
        "score_4o": "4",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output correctly identifies the relation as 'Harvest season,' which is functionally consistent with the standard answer 'Harvest Festivals.'

    },
    "Traditional Music(culture, mutual elements, Non-English European, English)": {
        "score_4o": "3",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output summarizes the relationship as 'Musical instruments,' which is correct but broad compared to the standard answer 'Traditional Music.'

    },
    "Folk Dance(culture, relation, Non-English European, English)": {
        "score_4o": "3",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output summarizes the relationship as 'Folk traditions,' which is similar to the standard answer 'Folk Dance,' encompassing the cultural aspect but not specifically focusing on dance. The explanation correctly associates the images with cultural heritage and folk traditions, but it lacks direct mention of clogs as footwear for certain folk dances and the specific mention of polka as an example, thus making it slightly incomplete."

        "score_4o": "4",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output summarizes the relationship between the images as 'Traditional attire,' which aligns well with the standard answer's 'National Dress.'

    "Cultural Etiquette(culture, relation, Non-English European, English)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output offers a very broad theme of 'Connection,' but lacks specific connections based on cultural greeting practices which is the core idea in the standard answer. It does not explicitly link the handshake to Western culture or the bow to East Asian culture, making the explanation insufficient according to the standard reasoning."
    },
    "Taboo Subjects(culture, relation, Non-English European, English)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output states the relationship as 'Distortion,' which does not align directly with the standard answer 'Taboo Subjects.' However, the explanation does convey similar thematic elements of 'alteration' and 'concealment,' which bear some resemblance to the idea of 'taboo.' The response broadly touches upon the notion of restricted communication and disruption but lacks the specific connection to 'taboo subjects.'"
    },
    "Body Language(culture, relation, NA, English)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output presents an overly broad interpretation of the images as 'Positivity,' which diverges from the standard answer of 'Body Language.' While it accurately captures a general positive theme, it does not align with the focus on body language, specifically crossed arms and thumbs-up gestures, as noted in the standard explanation."

        "score_4o": "3",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM output relates the images to 'Celebration,' which aligns with the theme of celebrations in the United States, specifically Independence Day, but is not as directly linked to 'United States' as the standard answer.

        "score_4o": "4",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output correctly identifies the relationship as 'Summary vs. Detail,' which aligns well with the standard answer 'Summary.' The explanation provided by the MLLM captures the essence of the TLDR concept by describing it as a way to summarize lengthy information concisely, similar to the standard explanation that TLDR indicates a summary or important points of a long text.

        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM output describes a general concept of 'Art and aesthetics,' which is too broad and does not address the specific relationship concerning the 'Sfumato technique description' as detailed in the standard answer.

    },
    "A melting clock  A dream sequence in a film(culture, relation, NA, English)": {
        "score_4o": "3",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output summarizes the relationship as 'Surrealism,' which is partially accurate as it aligns with the theme present in both images. However, the exact connection as per the standard answer is focused on the theme of 'dreams.' The explanation describes surreal elements and does capture some parts of the standard answer's explanation but doesn't highlight the theme of dreams specifically."

    "A Picasso portrait  Geometric shapes(art, relation, NA, English)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output suggests a relationship based on 'Geometry,' which is too broad compared to the specific relation mentioned in the standard answer, 'Picasso's Cubist style.' Although both explanations mention geometric shapes, the MLLM does not directly connect them to Picasso or his Cubist style, as described in the standard answer."

        "score_4o": "3",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output correctly identifies the relation as 'Art and language' through calligraphy, which aligns with the standard answer that focuses on 'calligraphy tool.' The explanation captures the intersection between brush pens and East Asian characters like Hanzi, Hanja, and Kanji, which is consistent with the notion of these characters being used in East Asian calligraphy. However, it doesn't explicitly mention ink brushes as traditional tools, making it slightly incomplete compared to the standard answer."
