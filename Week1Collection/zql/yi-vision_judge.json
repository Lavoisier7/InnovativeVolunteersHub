    "Tea Ceremony(culture, relation, East Asia, English)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output describes the relation as 'Natural Products', which is too broad and does not capture the concept of 'Tea Ceremony' found in the standard answer. The explanation mentions cultural significance but does not specifically connect to the shared cultural aspect of the tea ceremony involving matcha and cherry blossoms."
    },
    "Wedding Traditions(culture, mutual elements, Non-English European, English)": {
        "score_4o": "3",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output relates the images with the theme 'Celebration,' which is partially correct but broader than the specific standard answer 'Wedding Traditions.' However, the explanation effectively connects the items to weddings and engagements, which is consistent with the standard answer, even though it does not explicitly mention the 'western wedding ceremonies' context."
    },
    "Funeral Rites(culture, mutual elements, Non-English European, English)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output broadly addresses themes of life and death but does not establish a factual link between coffins and fashion models as related to 'Funeral Rites.' It misses the specific connection to funeral traditions involving black clothing mentioned in the standard answer, thus providing a more general explanation rather than one rooted in the precise reasoning given."
    },
    "Coming-of-Age Rituals(culture, relation, Non-English European, English)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's response identifies a broad connection between 'academic and formal' events but does not mention the specific coming-of-age rituals associated with the images, as detailed in the standard answer. The explanation lacks the focus on the concept of coming-of-age rituals, such as those related to a Quincea√±era, which is crucial for aligning with the standard reasoning."
    },
    "Harvest Festivals(culture, mutual elements, Non-English European, English)": {
        "score_4o": "3",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output identifies the relationship as 'Harvest,' which is similar to the standard answer's 'Harvest Festivals,' but lacks the explicit connection to festivals. The MLLM provides a general explanation about the association of both images with the harvest season, effectively mentioning the abundance of autumn produce and pumpkins as symbols. However, it does not delve into the specific cultural context of harvest festivals as the standard answer does."
    },
    "Traditional Music(culture, mutual elements, Non-English European, English)": {
        "score_4o": "3",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output classifies the relationship as 'Musical instruments,' which is slightly broader than the standard answer 'Traditional Music.' However, the explanation correctly notes the cultural significance of the violin and bagpipes as traditional musical instruments, aligning with the reasoning in the standard answer."
    },
    "Folk Dance(culture, relation, Non-English European, English)": {
        "score_4o": "3",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output summarizes the relationship between the images as 'Folk culture,' which is broadly correct and captures the theme of the images. The explanation correctly identifies clogs and traditional attire as elements of folk culture, but it does not specifically mention the connection to folk dance or polka, making it slightly incomplete compared to the standard answer."
    },
    "National Dress(culture, relation, Non-English European, English)": {
        "score_4o": "3",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output captures the idea of individuals dressed in traditional clothing from their respective cultures, which aligns with the theme of 'National Dress' in the standard answer. However, the relationship is described more broadly as 'Cultural heritage,' which is similar but not as precise as 'National Dress.' The explanation omits the specific detail about kilts and dirndls being national dresses, which is crucial for a 4-point score."
    },
    "Cultural Etiquette(culture, relation, Non-English European, English)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output describes the relationship as 'Symbolism' and discusses themes of formality and mutual respect. Although it does not directly address 'Cultural Etiquette' as specified in the standard answer, it correctly identifies that a handshake symbolizes agreement and formality, which aligns with cultural practices. However, the explanation for the pink satin ribbon diverges from the concept of etiquette, leading to an incomplete alignment with the standard answer."
    },
    "Taboo Subjects(culture, relation, Non-English European, English)": {
        "score_4o": "3",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output interprets the images as representing 'Fragmentation of communication,' which is thematically related but not as precise as the standard answer 'Taboo Subjects.' However, the explanation provided aligns in part with the standard answer, as both disrupted communication and taboo subjects involve restriction. The concept of fragmentation and disruption correlates with the idea of taboo, but the MLLM fails to directly identify the cultural aspect of taboos."
    },
    "Body Language(culture, relation, NA, English)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output identifies a broad theme of 'Confidence,' which is somewhat related but not specifically aligned with the 'Body Language' theme in the standard answer. The explanation includes an interpretation of body language gestures (crossed arms as confidence and thumbs-up as affirmation) that differs from the standard explanation (defensiveness and approval). The reasoning does not quite align with the intended reasoning in the standard answer."
    },
    "Oktoberfest(culture, mutual elements, Non-English European, English)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output identifies the relationship as 'Cultural heritage,' which is correct in a broad sense but does not specifically mention 'Oktoberfest,' which is central to the standard answer. The explanation refers to European traditions and specifies dirndl dresses, correctly associating them with Bavarian or German culture; however, it misses the specific context of Oktoberfest, a key event related to both beer steins and dirndl dresses."
    },
    "Hollywood  Walk of Fame star(culture, relation, NA, English)": {
        "score_4o": "4",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's response effectively captures the essence of the standard answer. It identifies 'Celebrity Culture' as the relation, which aligns with 'entertainment industry' as it encompasses the influence and presence of celebrities. The explanation accurately reflects the symbolic significance of the Hollywood Sign and the Walk of Fame Star, associating them with Hollywood and celebrity culture, just as the standard answer ties them to the entertainment industry. Both depict a deep understanding of the cultural significance and influence of these symbols in the entertainment realm."
    },
    "Fourth of July  Fireworks(culture, relation, USAEnglish, English)": {
        "score_4o": "3",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output captures the general theme of 'Patriotic celebration,' which is somewhat similar to the standard answer 'United States' but not as specific. The explanation addresses American patriotism and fireworks related to national pride, aligning with the standard reasoning. However, it doesn't directly mention 'Fourth of July,' which is a key aspect of the standard explanation."
    },
    "TLDR  A very long article(culture, relation, NA, English)": {
        "score_4o": "4",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output accurately captures the relationship between TL;DR and summarization. It correctly identifies the concept of TL;DR being related to summarizing long texts and aligns well with the standard answer's explanation, which discusses providing a summary or important points of long articles. The reasoning is also consistent with the standard answer."
    },
    "Baseball  Hotdog(culture, relation, USAEnglish, English)": {
        "score_4o": "3",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output identifies the relation as 'Sports and leisure,' which is broader than the standard answer 'Baseball.' However, it correctly mentions key facts such as the baseball glove being used in the sport and hotdogs being commonly consumed at events, which aligns with the standard explanation. The reasoning is similar, focusing on the association with baseball games."
    },
    "Mona Lisa  Sfumato technique description(art, relation, NA, English)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output provides a broad interpretation of 'transience' by juxtaposing permanence and impermanence, which is too general and doesn't align with the specific technique 'Sfumato' referenced by the standard answer. The explanation does not address the direct connection between the Mona Lisa's use of the Sfumato technique and the visual properties of smoke."
    },
    "A melting clock  A dream sequence in a film(culture, relation, NA, English)": {
        "score_4o": "4",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output accurately captures the essence of both images through the theme of 'Surrealism and dream-like quality.' The explanation mentions the surrealistic art style and the dream-like scenes, consistent with the standard answer's theme of 'dream.' The connection through surrealism and dream-like qualities aligns with the notion of dreams and dream sequences used in film narratives."
    },
    "A Picasso portrait  Geometric shapes(art, relation, NA, English)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output focuses on the shared use of color between the 'Abstract Portrait' and 'Geometric Shapes,' while the standard answer emphasizes Picasso's Cubist style, which is characterized by the integration of geometric shapes and forms in portraits. Although the MLLM's description captures the essence of the images' visual elements, it does not directly relate them to Picasso's Cubism as highlighted in the standard answer."
    },
    "Ink brush  A character in kanji or hanja(art, relation, East Asia, English)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM output describes the connection as 'Creativity,' which is too broad and does not align specifically with the 'calligraphy tool' relationship in the standard answer. Additionally, it doesn't mention the key facts related to calligraphy and its traditional tools. However, it does relate both images to the concept of creativity, partially aligning with the use of art supplies and educational illustrations."
