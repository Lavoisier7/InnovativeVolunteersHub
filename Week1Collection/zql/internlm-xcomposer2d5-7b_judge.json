    "Tea Ceremony(culture, relation, East Asia, English)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's response provides a broad theme of 'Nature' but fails to specifically connect the images to the concept of the 'Tea Ceremony,' as described in the standard answer. Although it acknowledges matcha's natural origins and cherry blossoms' beauty, it does not address their specific relationship to the tea ceremony."
    },
    "Wedding Traditions(culture, mutual elements, Non-English European, English)": {
        "score_4o": "3",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output characterizes the relationship as 'celebration,' which aligns with the theme of 'wedding traditions' in the standard answer, as weddings are indeed celebrations. While the explanation mentions wedding rings and floral arrangements in the context of weddings and celebrations, it lacks the specific emphasis on 'traditional elements' as stated in the standard answer. Despite this, the output still captures the essence of the connection to weddings, albeit in a slightly broader sense."
    },
    "Funeral Rites(culture, mutual elements, Non-English European, English)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output identifies 'mourning' as the relation, which is related to the concept of 'funeral rites' but broadens the focus to emotional and cultural aspects without specifically mentioning Western funeral traditions. The explanation captures the theme of mourning well but doesn't tie it specifically to 'funeral rites' as the standard answer does."
    },
    "Coming-of-Age Rituals(culture, relation, Non-English European, English)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output provides a broad explanation around the theme of 'Formal attire' that does not precisely capture the intended connection of 'Coming-of-Age Rituals.' It mentions formal events and life milestones but does not explicitly address the specific coming-of-age associations such as the Quinceañera, which is a key element in the standard answer. There are no erroneous statements or hallucinations in the output."
    },
    "Harvest Festivals(culture, mutual elements, Non-English European, English)": {
        "score_4o": "3",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output provides a relation of 'Seasonal abundance,' which is roughly correct but not as specific as 'Harvest Festivals' given in the standard answer. The explanation accurately describes the autumn theme and mentions themes of harvest, aligning partially with the standard answer's focus on symbols of harvest festivals."
    },
    "Traditional Music(culture, mutual elements, Non-English European, English)": {
        "score_4o": "3",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output captures the concept of 'Musical Instruments,' which roughly aligns with the standard answer 'Traditional Music.' While the MLLM emphasizes the distinction in instrument families (string and wind), it misses the focus on traditional music. However, the explanation notes the cultural and historical significance of both instruments, which aligns with the standard answer's reference to them as traditional instruments in Western music."
    },
    "Folk Dance(culture, relation, Non-English European, English)": {
        "score_4o": "3",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM output is roughly correct, recognizing a connection between 'shoes' and 'dance,' specifically mentioning 'traditional dance,' which aligns with the standard answer's concept of 'folk dance.’ However, the explanation is incomplete as it fails to specify 'clogs' as the type of footwear and 'polka' as the specific folk dance related to the images."
    },
    "National Dress(culture, relation, Non-English European, English)": {
        "score_4o": "4",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output provides a relation as 'Cultural attire,' which is consistent with the standard answer's 'National Dress,' as both refer to traditional dress specific to a nation or region. The explanation captures the diversity and cultural richness of traditional attire, consistent with the explanation involving kilts and dirndls as national dress. The reasoning aligns with the elements of the standard answer, accurately representing their traditional and national significance."
    },
    "Cultural Etiquette(culture, relation, Non-English European, English)": {
        "score_4o": "1",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output does not align with the standard answer 'Cultural Etiquette,' and proposes a 'Contrast' relationship with an explanation that involves formal agreements and festive occasions. The explanation seems unrelated to the intended context of cultural greetings. The response lacks any relevant connection to the standard answer, so it scores a 1 for not addressing the intended reasoning."
    },
    "Taboo Subjects(culture, relation, Non-English European, English)": {
        "score_4o": "3",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM output identifies a theme of 'Shattered Perception,' which aligns closely with the standard answer's notion of taboos obscuring or fragmenting reality. While the specific concept of 'Taboo Subjects' is not mentioned, the explanation ties in similar themes of obscured reality and perception. The explanation is roughly correct and somewhat echoes the standard answer but lacks the mention of cultural taboos associated with broken mirrors."
    },
    "Body Language(culture, relation, NA, English)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output summarizes the relationship as 'Positive feedback or approval,' which deviates from the standard answer's 'Body Language.' While the explanation associates the thumbs-up with approval, it misinterprets the crossed arms as a sign of confidence rather than defensiveness, showing it does not fully align with the reasoning in the standard answer."
    },
    "Oktoberfest(culture, mutual elements, Non-English European, English)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM output describes the connection between the images as 'Traditional,' highlighting the theme of tradition in both porcelain containers and a dirndl dress. While the explanation offers relevant observations, it is too broad and does not address the specific connection to 'Oktoberfest' as outlined in the standard answer. The key facts about beer steins and traditional attire related to Oktoberfest are missing in the explanation."
    },
    "Hollywood  Walk of Fame star(culture, relation, NA, English)": {
        "score_4o": "4",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output correctly identifies the relation as 'Celebrity and Recognition,' which is consistent with the standard answer theme of the 'entertainment industry.' The explanation accurately describes the Hollywood Sign as a symbol of the film industry and the Walk of Fame Star as a recognition of contributions to the entertainment industry. These interpretations align well with the standard answer."
    },
    "Fourth of July  Fireworks(culture, relation, USAEnglish, English)": {
        "score_4o": "3",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output identifies the relation as 'Celebration,' which is broadly correct but not as specific as 'United States.' The explanation accurately captures the context of the American flag and fireworks, closely aligning with the standard answer, but it lacks emphasis on the specific connection to Fourth of July celebrations."
    },
    "TLDR  A very long article(culture, relation, NA, English)": {
        "score_4o": "4",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output accurately captures the essence of both images, with 'TLDR' representing a summarized version of information derived from 'a text document.' The explanation aligns with the standard answer by highlighting the process of summarizing complex information for effective communication."
    },
    "Baseball  Hotdog(culture, relation, USAEnglish, English)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output describes the relationship between the images as 'Sports equipment and food item,' which is too broad compared to the standard answer 'Baseball.' While mentioning the baseball glove as sports equipment used in baseball, it fails to connect the hot dog directly to baseball games. Consequently, the MLLM's explanation lacks alignment with the specific context of baseball games provided in the standard answer."
    },
    "Mona Lisa  Sfumato technique description(art, relation, NA, English)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM output describes the relationship as 'Contrast' and contrasts the lifelike quality of the Mona Lisa with the abstract nature of the smoke, which is too broad. It doesn't align with the specific technique of 'Sfumato,' which was intended in the standard answer. The explanation lacks the relevant facts about the Sfumato technique, which creates a smoky effect connecting both images."
    },
    "A melting clock  A dream sequence in a film(culture, relation, NA, English)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's response identifies the relation as 'Unusual architecture' and emphasizes the surreal elements, which only broadly touch upon the theme of dreams. It doesn't capture the specific link to 'dream' as outlined in the standard answer. While the explanation hints at unconventional and dreamlike visual perception, it lacks the direct association with dreams conveyed in the standard explanation."
    },
    "A Picasso portrait  Geometric shapes(art, relation, NA, English)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM response discusses a theme of 'Abstract Art vs. Geometric Illustration,' which is too broad and does not capture the specific connection to 'Picasso's Cubist style.' While acknowledging the use of shapes and colors, it misses the key aspect of Picasso's incorporation of geometric shapes in his portraits, which aligns with Cubism as mentioned in the standard answer."
    },
    "Ink brush  A character in kanji or hanja(art, relation, East Asia, English)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM output identifies the theme as 'Writing Systems', which is related but not specifically aligned with the standard answer's focus on 'calligraphy tool'. It addresses writing and communication broadly but doesn't mention the specific connection between calligraphy instruments (such as ink brushes) and East Asian characters (kanji or hanja), which is the key point in the standard explanation."
