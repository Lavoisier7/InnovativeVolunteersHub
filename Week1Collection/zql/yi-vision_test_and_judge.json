            "score_4o": "2",
            "score_reason": "The MLLM's output broadly addresses themes of life and death but does not establish a factual link between coffins and fashion models as related to 'Funeral Rites.'

            "score_4o": "2",
            "score_reason": "The MLLM's response identifies a broad connection between 'academic and formal' events but does not mention the specific coming-of-age rituals associated with the images, as detailed in the standard answer.

            "score_reason": "The MLLM's output identifies the relationship as 'Harvest,' which is similar to the standard answer's 'Harvest Festivals,' but lacks the explicit connection to festivals. The MLLM provides a general explanation about the association of both images with the harvest season, effectively mentioning the abundance of autumn produce and pumpkins as symbols. However, it does not delve into the specific cultural context of harvest festivals as the standard answer does."

The handshake represents a mutual agreement between two parties, often seen in professional or formal settings.

        "judge_answer": {
            "score_4o": "3",
            "score_reason": "The MLLM's output interprets the images as representing 'Fragmentation of communication,' which is thematically related but not as precise as the standard answer 'Taboo Subjects.' However, the explanation provided aligns in part with the standard answer, as both disrupted communication and taboo subjects involve restriction. The concept of fragmentation and disruption correlates with the idea of taboo, but the MLLM fails to directly identify the cultural aspect of taboos."

The Mona Lisa, an iconic artwork, has endured for centuries, symbolizing the lasting impact of human creativity. In contrast, the smoke, with its ephemeral nature, signifies the fleeting moments and the impermanence of life.

The first image presents an abstract portrait with a riot of colors, where each color defines a part of the face.
