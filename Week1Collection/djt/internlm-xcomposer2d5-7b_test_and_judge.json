It conveys a sense of movement and dynamism.\n- Relation: The common theme between the two images is the dove, which is a universal symbol of peace and hope. Despite their stylistic differences, both images capture the essence of the dove's flight and its symbolic meanings.\n- Explanation: The realistic portrayal in the first image contrasts with the abstract interpretation in the second image, highlighting the versatility of the dove's representation in art and symbolism.
