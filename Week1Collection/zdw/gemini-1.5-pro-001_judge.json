    "Sports Bar(visible, sports, relation, USAEnglish, English)": {
        "score_4o": "3",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output summarizes the relationship as 'Social Gathering,' which is a broad but related theme to 'Sports Bar.' While it captures the essence of activities and refreshments enjoyed in social settings, it does not specify 'Sports Bar.' The explanation aligns partially with the standard answer, but lacks the specific context of a sports bar environment."

    "The music(You'll Never Walk Alone)(invisible, sports, relation, USAEnglish, English)": {
        "score_4o": "4",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output correctly identifies the relation as 'Anthem' and thoroughly explains the connection between the song 'You'll Never Walk Alone,' Gerry and the Pacemakers, Liverpool FC, and the Shankly Gates at Anfield. This matches the level of detail, thoughtfulness, and thematic connection in the standard answer, where the song is detailed as both the anthem of Liverpool Football Club and linked intricately to the Shankly Gates at Anfield."

    "乒乓外交(invisible, sports, relation, East Asia, Chinese)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM output establishes a connection between table tennis and China, which is a factually correct relationship as table tennis is indeed significant within Chinese culture. However, the explanation does not align with the standard answer's focus on 'Ping Pong Diplomacy,' which is a specific historical event involving table tennis and China. The MLLM output does not mention this historical context, making its explanation too broad relative to the standard answer."
    },
    "功夫(visible, sports, relation, East Asia, Chinese)": {
        "score_4o": "3",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM output presents 'Origins of martial arts' as the relationship, which is close but not as precise as '功夫' (Kung Fu). The explanation touches on Bruce Lee's role in martial arts and mentions the cultural and historical significance of a traditional temple, somewhat aligning with how the Shaolin Monastery is viewed in relation to Kung Fu. However, it doesn't explicitly mention Kung Fu or the specific connection to the Shaolin Monastery, lacking some details present in the standard answer."
    },
    "蹴鞠(visible, sports, relation, East Asia, Chinese)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output describes the relationship between the two images as 'Luxury and Adornment', which differs from the standard answer '蹴鞠' (Cuju). While the MLLM provides a thematic interpretation involving luxury, it does not address the specific connection regarding Emperor Taizu's interest in Cuju and the feather-stuffed ball used in the game. However, the description does touch on themes of culture and aesthetics, which may have some general relevance but lack specific linkage related to Cuju."

    "Белка(visible, animal, relation, Non-English European, Russian)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's response emphasizes the theme of 'Growth and potential,' which is very broad and not aligned with the specific relationship identified in the standard answer ('Белка,' meaning 'squirrel'). The explanation highlights the idea of cyclical nature, but it does not address the connection between the tree hollow and acorns in relation to squirrels that is central to the standard answer. No factual errors are present in the MLLM's explanation."
    },
    "Беркут(visible, animal, relation, Non-English European, Russian)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output summarizes the relationship as 'Food chain,' which is too broad and does not align with the specific connection to 'Беркут' or Golden Eagles as specified in the standard answer. While the mention of rabbits and mountainous regions is somewhat relevant, the response lacks the specificity found in the standard answer. The MLLM did not capture the key details about Golden Eagles preying on rabbits in mountainous habitats."
