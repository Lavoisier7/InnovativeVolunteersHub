    "score_reason": "The MLLM's output suggests the relation 'Preparation,' which is too broad and diverges from the standard answer's concept of a 'Null set.' The explanation lacks relevant facts from the standard answer and misinterprets the imagery without acknowledging the symbolic representation of an empty set."
