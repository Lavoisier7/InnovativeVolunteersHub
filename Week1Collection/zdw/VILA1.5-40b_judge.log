Folder: В жизни не бывает случайностей, все предопределено(visible, art, mutual elements, Non-English European, Russian)
{
    "score_4o": "1",
    "score_reason": "The MLLM output focuses on the presence of a path in the mazes, which doesn't address the deeper philosophical connection about predetermination suggested in the standard answer. It doesn't interpret the maze as a metaphor for life journey or any significant philosophical concept, and thus, the response remains quite literal and surface-level."

Folder: انگور کھٹے ہیں(visible, art, relation, Arabic-Islamic, Urdu)
{
    "score_4o": "2",
    "score_reason": "The MLLM output defines both images as depicting 'a bunch of green grapes,' but it describes them in such a literal way that it misses the broader, intended relationship of 'sour grapes' and its symbolic meaning in literature. It recognizes the similarity between two grape images but does not incorporate the underlying concept presented in the standard answer, which connects the images to Aesop's fable."

Folder: پانی میں رہ کر مگرسچائی کو نہیں بھولنا(visible, art, relation, Arabic-Islamic, Urdu)
{
    "score_4o": "0",
    "score_reason": "The MLLM's explanation is factually incorrect as it misinterprets the images. Instead of identifying a deeper symbolic meaning relating to navigating life while maintaining integrity, the MLLM merely describes the images as 'similar,' focusing on the literal visual content without capturing any underlying symbolism or thematic connections presented in the standard answer."

Folder: چڑیا کے گھر میں نہ بیٹھو(visible, art, mutual elements, Arabic-Islamic, Urdu)
{
    "score_4o": "2",
    "score_reason": "The MLLM output accurately identifies the literal content of the images as 'a bird's nest in a tree.' However, it does not capture the metaphorical or symbolic significance that is highlighted in the standard answer, which revolves around respecting personal space. The explanation provided does not align closely with the intended reasoning focused on boundaries and personal space."

Folder: جو بوؤ گے، وہی کاٹو گ(visible, art, mutual elements, Arabic-Islamic, Urdu)
{
    "score_4o": "2",
    "score_reason": "The MLLM's output identifies the basic commonality of a 'Man and bucket of seeds' in both images but does not capture the deeper thematic significance outlined in the standard answer. By focusing purely on the literal elements, it misses the metaphor of 'You reap what you sow,' which relates to the broader life lesson depicted."

Folder: دیر آید، درست آید(visible, art, mutual elements, Arabic-Islamic, Urdu)
{
    "score_4o": "1",
    "score_reason": "The MLLM's output states that both images show a digital clock with red numbers, noting the backgrounds, but lacks the interpretive connection to the phrase 'Better late than never.' The response does not attempt to align the images with this conceptual theme and purely provides a description, without addressing the standard reasoning."

Folder: خود کو پہچانو(visible, art, relation, Arabic-Islamic, Urdu)
{
    "score_4o": "2",
    "score_reason": "The MLLM output identifies the common element in both images as 'Mirror,' which is a literal observation of the images but too broad and not aligned with the deeper meaning of 'Know thyself' in the standard answer. Although the response does not contain any factual errors, it misses the introspective aspect emphasized in the standard answer, focusing only on the physical depiction without connecting it to self-awareness or introspection."

{
    "score_4o": "2",
    "score_reason": "The MLLM's output describes the images as depicting the sky, focusing on the visual aspects of stars and clouds. While this is technically true, it is too broad and does not align with the thematic explanation provided in the standard answer. The standard answer relates the images more deeply to the concept of desires and unfulfilled dreams, which is not captured in the MLLM's explanation."

While it does not accurately relate them to the standard answer's theme of 'unattainable love' and 'unexpressed thoughts,' it does focus correctly on visual elements. However, it completely misses the symbolic interpretation present in the standard answer."

    "score_4o": "0",
    "score_reason": "The MLLM's response inaccurately describes all images as sunsets or sunrises over the ocean, missing the thematic connection of acceptance toward life and death as indicated in the standard answer.

    "score_reason": "The MLLM's response is incorrect and suggests a relationship that is far less meaningful than the standard answer. It fails to identify the circles as the Olympic rings. Instead, it repeatedly describes the visual elements without exploring their symbolic significance or relation to the Olympic movement. This demonstrates a factuality hallucination regarding the cultural and symbolic context of the imagery."
