            "score_reason": "The MLLM's output identifies the relation as 'Spiral motif,' which is loosely related but does not specifically mention the 'Golden Ratio.' The explanation correctly identifies the common element of spirals in both the nautilus shell and abstract painting but misses the mathematical aspect of the Golden Ratio highlighted in the standard answer."

    "Mirror reflection(visible, STEM, metaphor, NA, English)": {
        "MLLM_answer": "- First image: A decorative mirror with a golden ornate frame leaning against a blue wall on a white surface.\n- Second image: An empty picture frame with intricate carvings placed upright on a flat surface.\n- Relation: Both images feature objects with elaborate wooden frames that exhibit similar artistic characteristics.\n- Explanation: The frames in both pictures share an aesthetic of classical elegance and craftsmanship, suggesting a theme of antique or vintage design elements. The similarity in their appearance indicates a potential connection in style or purpose, possibly reflecting a shared appreciation for traditional decorative arts.",
        "judge_answer": {
            "score_4o": "2",
            "score_reason": "The MLLM output focuses on the aesthetic and craftsmanship of the frames, which is related to their artistic characteristics. However, it does not delve into the concept of 'mirror reflection' or the themes of self-perception and introspection mentioned in the standard answer. The explanation is too broad and lacks reference to the reasoning about the reflective and introspective qualities present in the standard answer."

    "Pascal's triangle(visible, STEM, metaphor, NA, English)": {
        "MLLM_answer": "- First image: A structured array of hexagons in a pyramid shape, displaying a sequence of numbers from 1 to 10 on each level.\n- Second image: The same arrangement of hexagons with numbers, but this time, the pattern appears more complex with some levels having three hexagons while others have four.\n- Relation: Pattern Variation\n- Explanation: Both images depict similar geometric structures with numerical sequences, yet they exhibit different patterns in terms of the number of hexagons per level. This variation suggests an evolution or development within the same structure, possibly indicating a progression or a dynamic change in the arrangement.",
        "judge_answer": {
            "score_4o": "2",
            "score_reason": "The MLLM's output describes the relation as 'Pattern Variation,' which is too broad and does not align with the specific relation of 'Pascal's triangle' as mentioned in the standard answer. While the MLLM effectively captures the idea of numerical sequences in a geometric structure, it misses the context of Pascal's Triangle, which is crucial for combinatorial and mathematical significance."

    "Prime Numbers(invisible, STEM, relation, NA, English)": {
        "MLLM_answer": "- First image: A seamless, unbroken chain displayed horizontally, symbolizing unity, reliability, and continuity.\n- Second image: A broken chain with links separated and one link missing, representing fragility, vulnerability, and interruption.\n- Relation: Contrast in states of being\n- Explanation: The two images together present a narrative on the duality of chains – their strength when united and their weakness when disrupted. The first image embodies stability and solidarity, while the second illustrates the fragility that can lead to failure, emphasizing the importance of connection and integrity.",
        "judge_answer": {
            "score_4o": "2",
            "score_reason": "The MLLM's response identifies the relation as 'Contrast in states of being,' which is too broad and does not align with the specific concept of 'Prime Numbers' as presented in the standard answer. The explanation focuses on dual aspects of chains rather than connecting to the idea of indivisibility, which is central to the comparison with prime numbers."

        "MLLM_answer": "- First image: An open cardboard box with visible folds and creases, depicted from an overhead perspective against a white background.\n- Second image: A close-up of a hand holding a pen above a notepad, ready to write.\n- Relation: \"Preparation\"\n- Explanation: Both images convey a sense of preparation. The first image shows a box, often associated with packaging or setting something up, while the second image features an individual in the act of writing, which can signify planning or noting down important details. Together, they suggest a theme of preparation for an activity or event.",
        "judge_answer": {
            "score_4o": "2",
            "score_reason": "The MLLM's output suggests the relation 'Preparation,' which is too broad and diverges from the standard answer's concept of a 'Null set.' The explanation lacks relevant facts from the standard answer and misinterprets the imagery without acknowledging the symbolic representation of an empty set."
