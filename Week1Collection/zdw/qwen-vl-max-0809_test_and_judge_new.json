        "MLLM_answer": "- First image: A single round tortilla with a textured surface.\n- Second image: A colorful assortment of small, round objects that resemble candies or pills.\n- Relation: Contrast in color and texture.\n- Explanation: The first image features a plain, beige-colored tortilla with a simple texture, while the second image shows a vibrant mix of multicolored round objects. The contrast between the two images lies in their visual appeal; the tortilla is understated and neutral, whereas the colorful objects are eye-catching and lively.",

            "score_reason": "The MLLM output identifies a general contrast in color and texture, but it does not address the intended concept of a pizza, which is characterized by its flatbread base and colorful toppings. It fails to connect the tortilla and colorful objects as representing pizza components."
