Image 3 shows a sunny day, which could be representative of summer or early spring. To mirror the relationship between these images, Image 4 should represent another seasonal phenomenon, such as raindrops, which is often associated with spring or summer after a period of dryness. The connection here is the cyclical nature of the seasons and how different weather conditions are linked to them.",
