This response displays uncertainty in capturing the specific relationship intended by the standard answer, particularly in the context of cultural symbols of abundance, hence scoring 1 point for vague connection."

The MLLM's Image 4 is different from the Standard Answer's sundial and it doesn't match the intended theme of traditional faith methods.

The relation observed as 'Symbol of Change' is reasonable and related to cycles but doesn't match the standard answer's seasonal transition through symbols (autumn to summer). While the logic is somewhat correct concerning change, it is an incomplete match for the specific symbols and examples provided in the standard answer."
