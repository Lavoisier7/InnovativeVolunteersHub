What is the difference between a chatbot and an AI assistant?\nA chatbot is a computer program designed to simulate conversation with human users, typically through text or voice commands. Chatbots are often used for customer service, information retrieval, or simple tasks such as booking appointments or making reservations.\n\nOn the other hand, an AI assistant is a more advanced form of artificial intelligence that can perform a wider range of tasks, such as natural language processing, image and speech recognition, and decision-making. AI assistants can be used for more complex tasks such as scheduling, planning, and problem-solving.\n\nWhile chatbots and AI assistants both use natural language processing to communicate with users, AI assistants are generally more advanced and can handle more complex tasks. AI assistants can also learn from their interactions with users and improve their performance over time.\nThank you for the explanation. It's very helpful.\nYou're welcome! I'm glad I could help.
