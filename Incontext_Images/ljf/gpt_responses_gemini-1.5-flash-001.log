The image is taken from below and shows a clear blue sky in the background. However, the friends are wearing slightly more formal clothing and have a more relaxed expression, signifying that the event is less exciting.\n- **Relation**: Progression of time, from initial excitement to a more relaxed state.\n- **Explanation**: Both Image 1 and Image 2 depict mangoes in different stages of ripeness, with Image 1 representing a more mature state, while Image 2 represents a less mature state. The same progression is mirrored in the second pair, where Image 3 shows friends cheering and raising their hands in a more lively setting. Image 4 depicts the same group of friends in a similar scenario, but their attire and expression suggest a more relaxed atmosphere, possibly signifying the passage of time and a shift from an initial state of excitement to a more relaxed and comfortable state. \n"

The waterfall's single stream diverges into a multitude of smaller streams as it flows, similar to how a mountain range branches out into individual peaks. Applying this concept to Image 3, we can imagine the river's branches extending outwards like the spokes of a wheel, culminating in a network of islands. Therefore, Image 4, depicting a starlit sky with constellations representing the islands, mirrors this branching pattern.

The water is clear and reflects the sunlight, revealing a ripple pattern.\n- **Image 4**: A close-up shot of the river flowing over a single, moss-covered boulder. The water is calm and clear, with the sun reflecting off its surface.\n- **Relation**: **Water flow** - the river moving from fast-paced rapids in a forest to a serene, reflective flow over rocks.\n- **Explanation**: Both pairs show the river in different states of motion. The first pair contrasts the energetic rapids in the forest with the calm, sun-drenched flow over rocks. The second pair highlights the river's transition from a broader, turbulent flow over numerous rocks to a more focused, reflective flow over a single boulder, mimicking the first pair's movement from a dynamic forest setting to a serene rock environment. \n"

The relationship between the two pairs is the contrast between actively adjusting the angle of the panel to maximize energy absorption and leaving the panel in a fixed position. The tracking systems in Image 1 and 2 offer more efficient energy generation by constantly optimizing the panel's angle, while the fixed systems in Image 3 and 4 provide a simpler and less costly solution that may compromise efficiency for convenience."
