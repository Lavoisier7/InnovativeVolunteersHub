Image 3 takes this concept further into an abstract, more conceptual representation of light as rays spreading outwards.

The branching structure serves as a unifying element across these diverse subjects.",

This is reflected in Image 3, which illustrates how Earth's magnetic field varies between the hemispheres, with the south having stronger fields. Image 4 completes the set by showing a celestial body exhibiting a similar polarity difference in magnetic field strength.",

Image 4 would show the need for significant investment to yield high returns, much like the weight on the 'return' side of Image 2.

Image 3 represents the central component responsible for handling this air. By placing Image 4 outdoors, it visually reinforces the idea that the Air Handler/Furnace operates externally to manage the outside air, completing the cycle depicted in Image 1.",
