Image 2 showcases traditional Japanese architecture. Image 3 depicts wind in a stylized way. Image 4 would then represent a cultural element related to wind, such as a sail on a traditional Japanese boat, mirroring the link between a figure (emperor) and a physical representation of that culture (architecture) in the first pair. \n",

A baroque violin represents the Baroque period when these instruments were widely used, but it's also linked to composers like Bach.  Einstein, with his iconic look, represents genius and scientific exploration.  A classic white dress doesn't point to a specific person, so Image 4 should be an image of Coco Chanel, known for popularizing the \"little black dress\" and revolutionizing women's fashion. \n",

Image 1's artifact might have had religious significance, echoed in the halo of the deity in Image 2. Similarly, Image 3 uses a sun-like orb and symmetrical wings in the Egyptian symbol, which often represents protection and divinity.

The warrior's armor and stance suggest strength, while the eagle, often a national symbol, embodies power and freedom. Applying this relationship, Image 3 (sage) represents wisdom and serenity, so Image 4 would need to depict a creature symbolic of wisdom and peace, hence the owl.

Image 3 shows the macroscopic growth rings of a tree, which are formed due to the cellular structure and composition of wood. Image 4, depicting the fibrous structure of cellulose, the main component of wood, mirrors this relationship by showing the microscopic arrangement responsible for the tree's macroscopic appearance. \n",
