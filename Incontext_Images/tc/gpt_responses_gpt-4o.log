Similarly, the bow is a tool for archery, suggesting that Image 4 should also relate to archery as a functional, traditional object, like an arrow.

For the second pair, the small blue bird can be contrasted with a larger bird, like an eagle, emphasizing size differences while both belong to the natural world.

The Greek vase is crafted from clay and artistically painted, while the crystals are formed naturally over time. For Image 3 and Image 4, the latex is tapped from the tree and then processed into a usable form, mirroring the transformation theme seen between the first pair.",
