To mirror this relationship, Image 4 should combine a mythical creature (the griffin) with historical elements (ancient architecture), similar to how Image 3 presents an ancient stone well. This creates a parallel where both pairs integrate fantasy with reality or history.",

Both images feature vibrant colors and intricate details. The human eye in **Image 1** has a detailed iris with shades of blue, while the dragon in **Image 2** is depicted with a mix of red and blue scales and elaborate features.\n\nTo create **Image 4** that mirrors this relationship with **Image 3**, we should aim to incorporate vibrant colors and detailed features into an image that complements the frog. A suitable choice could be an illustration of a colorful butterfly, which shares the theme of vibrant colors and intricate patterns.\n\n- **Image 4**: An illustration of a colorful butterfly with detailed wings.\n\n- **Relation**: Vibrant colors and detailed features.\n- **Explanation**: Just as the human eye in **Image 1** and the dragon in **Image 2** share a theme of vibrant colors and intricate details, the green frog in **Image 3** and the colorful butterfly in **Image 4** also share these characteristics. The butterfly's detailed wing patterns and bright colors complement the frog's vivid green skin and detailed eyes, maintaining the thematic connection established by the first pair",

To mirror this relationship, **Image 4** is created to feature a personal care tool (lipstick) in use, similar to how the axe is a tool for physical labor.

While Image 1 depicts a healthy, natural habitat for the rabbit, Image 2 shows a harsh, dry environment that could be detrimental to wildlife. To mirror this relationship between Image 3 and Image 4, Image 4 should depict an environment that contrasts with the arid conditions suggested by the crow's habitat in Image 3. Therefore, Image 4 is designed to show a lush, green, and well-watered area, which provides a stark contrast to the dry, sandy environment of Image 3, similar to how Image 2 contrasts with Image 1.",

To mirror this relationship, Image 4 should feature a piece of jewelry (like a bracelet) that also represents personal value, similar to the necklace in Image 2, but with a charm that directly relates to security, such as a padlock.

Image 2 depicts the extraction of rubber from a tree, which is a natural resource used in many products. The connection here is the transformation of natural materials into usable products. For Image 4, since Image 3 shows quartz crystals, a natural mineral, Image 4 should depict other natural minerals or gemstones to maintain the theme of natural resources. This parallels the relationship between Images 1 and 2, where both images relate to natural materials and their uses.",
