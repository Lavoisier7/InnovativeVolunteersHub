Image 2 does not directly relate to risk or reward but could be seen as a metaphor for collecting or storing rewards (or benefits) gained through taking risks. Image 3 shows individuals coming together as a group, which is similar to the idea of working together to achieve a common goal, akin to managing risk to achieve a better outcome. Image 4 visually represents the concept of a community, where individuals come together, much like the monks in Image 3, to share experiences and resources, which parallels the collaborative aspect of managing risk to enhance outcomes.",
