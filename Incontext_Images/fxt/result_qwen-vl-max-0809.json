Image 2, while not directly historical, is associated with Andy Warhol's pop art movement, which is a significant cultural milestone. The connection here is the representation of important historical moments. Applying this to Image 3, which depicts the fall of the Berlin Wall, a major historical event, Image 4 should similarly represent significant historical events. Therefore, Image 4 could be a collection of photographs of other pivotal moments in history, such as the end of World War II, the signing of the Declaration of Independence, or the fall of the Soviet Union, arranged in a grid to mirror the structure of Image 2.",

To mirror this relationship, Image 4 should depict another significant cultural or historical event, drawing inspiration from the abstract style of Image 3. For example, Image 4 could be an abstract representation of a famous scientific discovery or a landmark artistic movement.",

Similarly, Image 3 presents a commercial product as high art through the lens of pop art. To mirror this transformation, Image 4 should depict the Campbell's Soup can in a context that elevates it beyond its commercial origins, such as in a gallery setting where it is being critically examined or appreciated as a piece of art.
