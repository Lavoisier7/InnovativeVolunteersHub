        "- **Image 1**: A man is sitting at a desk in a well-lit office, smiling as he works on a computer.\n- **Image 2**: A man is sitting at a desk in a home office, looking thoughtful or bored as he works on a laptop.\n- **Image 3**: A man is playing the violin with a focused expression, dressed in a suit.\n- **Image 4**: A man is playing the guitar with a relaxed expression, dressed in casual clothing.\n- **Relation**: Work and leisure\n- **Explanation**: The first pair of images shows a contrast between a positive work environment and a less positive one, while the second pair shows a contrast between a formal musical performance and a more casual one. Both pairs highlight the importance of finding balance between work and leisure, and the impact that environment and attitude can have on our experiences."
