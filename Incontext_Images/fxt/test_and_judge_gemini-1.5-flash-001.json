The figure in Image 1 (triangle) is the dual of the figure in Image 2 (triangle). The same principle applies to the pair in Image 3 and Image 4. This means that the vertices of one figure become the sides of its dual, and vice versa. The number of sides in one figure equals the number of vertices in its dual.  \n\nThis duality can be observed by exchanging the roles of points and lines in the constructions. For example, in Image 1, the points of intersection of the circle and the triangle become the sides of the triangle in Image 2, and the sides of the triangle in Image 1 become the vertices of the triangle in Image 2. This duality is a fundamental concept in geometry that reveals a hidden relationship between figures.  \n",

In the background, a woman with a child in her arms looks on in fear, and another woman in a white dress sits with her face in her hands.\n\n- **Relation**: Sacrifice\n\n- **Explanation**: Both pairs of images show the moments leading to a death. In the first pair, the woman on the chaise lounge represents the death of freedom.  The man with swords is on the verge of killing himself, sacrificing his own life for the freedom of his family. In the second pair, the woman on the barricade symbolizes the death of the French monarchy.  The man in red is about to be sacrificed to establish freedom in",

Image 3 similarly focuses on a lone individual amidst a vast, almost all-encompassing landscape, evoking feelings of isolation and contemplation.

Image 4 mirrors this sense of solitude, showing a lone figure gazing out at an empty landscape. The solitude in Image 4 is different from the solitude in Image 2.

Public Enemy's album cover uses a visual metaphor of the police state and its oppressive forces. Stevie Wonder's \"Black Man\" directly addresses the struggles of African Americans through lyrics and melody. Similarly, Lady Gaga's \"Born This Way\" explores issues of self-acceptance and societal pressures on individuals. Image 4 would connect to Image 3 by using musical notation to represent the message of empowerment and individuality inherent in Gaga's song.
