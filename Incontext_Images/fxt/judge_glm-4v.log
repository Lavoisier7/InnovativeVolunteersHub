    "score_reason": "The MLLM envisions progression and potential with a blank canvas, but the connection diverges from the dedication/action significance ('Violin must be played'). Instead, it discusses evolving processes from technological engagement, showing a departure from the standard’s consistent thematic thread."

    "score_reason": "While MLLM discusses transition stages in work settings, it lacks the proactive engagement reasoning ('Violin must be played') as afterward emphasized by the standard. The focus is on workspace setup not akin to the needed activity for results theme, hence disconnecting from interpreting commitment."
