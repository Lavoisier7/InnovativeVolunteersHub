The shark is encased in a tank, creating an unusual, permanent display of life. Similarly, Image 2 takes a common balloon animal and elevates it to art through its material and size. Following this theme, Image 4 should transform the realistic portrait (Image 3) into something that alters our perception through its medium or context, like a polished, reflective sculpture.",

Similarly, the transition in the second pair should move from the realistic and classical form of the statue to an abstract interpretation using geometric shapes. This mirrors the evolution in art from detailed realism to abstraction, emphasizing form and concept over literal representation.",
