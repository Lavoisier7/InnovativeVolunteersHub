Similarly, Image 3’s individual dance expression will transform into a group performance in Image 4, representing the culmination of a dance creation and echoing the transformation seen between Image 1 and Image 2.",

The dancer and pianist are both engaged in live artistic expressions, which involve physical presence and movement. To mirror this, Image 3's vibrant painting activity can be paired with an Image 4 featuring a sculptor in a monochrome setting. Both Image 3 and Image 4 involve visual art creation, with the key distinction reflecting the vibrant versus monochrome contrast seen between the first two images.",

They emphasize the beauty and expression found in these art forms, each using a distinct medium and style. Image 3 is a colorful artwork conveying the beauty of nature.
