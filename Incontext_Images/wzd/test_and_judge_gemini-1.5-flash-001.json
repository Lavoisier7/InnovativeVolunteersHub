The posters and the book covers both employ a similar visual style and color scheme. In both cases, the poster features a more complex design with a larger image of the protagonist and a more elaborate visual background, while the book cover features a more minimalist design with a single abstract shape.

The same pattern can be observed in the second pair, with a green candle image created to complete the series, following the order of yellow and red.

Image 1 presents a dish, while Image 2 adds context by showing it served with a spoon, pepper shakers, and a pot. Similarly, Image 3 depicts a religious figure, while Image 4 brings a visual narrative to life by incorporating a dish and its setting, making the figure interact with a scene. The connection between Image 1 and Image 2 and the connection between Image 3 and Image 4 reflects a visual storytelling strategy, where the initial image presents a subject, while the second image extends its story by adding context and enhancing its meaning. \n",

The explanation lacks alignment with the cultural musical expressions theme, missing critical connections needed for coherence."
