    "score_4o": "2",
    "score_reason": "The MLLM provided a different interpretation focusing on part-to-whole relationships that is reasonable but does not follow the cultural symbolism that the standard answer emphasized. The described Image 4 shifts focus from the tram to the people, missing the geographical significance linking Image 3 to Lisbon's hills. The relationship between the food item and the tram as cultural symbols was not identified."

    "score_reason": "The MLLM emphasized the visual and detailed contrast between cityscapes and King Cake close-ups.
