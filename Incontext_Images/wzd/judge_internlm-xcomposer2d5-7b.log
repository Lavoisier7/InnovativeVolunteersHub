    "score_reason": "The MLLM output correctly identifies a contrast between confinement and liberation, similar to the standard answer. However, the proposed Image 4 is more a metaphorical interpretation rather than a literal one, as compared to the standard answer's open poetry book. The reasoning captures the symbolic contrast effectively, warranting a score of 3 as it generally aligns with the idea but misses some specific elements."

Instead of the classroom with students engaged in discussion (standard), it proposed combining elements of the prison cell, book, and bird, maintaining the thematic relation. The MLLM's explanation was logical but didn't match the specific cinematic inspiration aspect of the standard answer, scoring it a 3."

The standard answer focused on symbols of freedom, which the MLLM missed. Therefore, it receives a score of 2 for being broad but not aligning with the specific cinematic inspirations."

{

    "score_reason": "The MLLM focuses on familial connection and structure, proposing a family tree for Image 4, which aligns with the theme of familial bonds. This shares some similarities with the standard's focus on familial legacy and hierarchy. However, the MLLM's response diverges from the specific symbol of leadership and the royal crown's legacy function, thus meriting a 3 for reasonable but incomplete alignment."

However, it did not specifically align with the video game-centric reasoning and specific example of 'Breath of the Wild' as seen in the standard answer, resulting in a score of 3 for generally correct interpretation but incomplete alignment with the standard."

The MLLM's approach is inventive but diverges from the more direct puzzle game comparison expected, yielding a score of 2."

{
    "score_4o": "3",
    "score_reason": "The MLLM identifies key themes of adventure and heroism in 'Final Fantasy XIV' and 'World of Warcraft' cover arts but focuses on the concept art creation for Image 4 instead of a gameplay screenshot.

{
    "score_4o": "3",
    "score_reason": "The MLLM explanation focuses correctly on combat representations from 'World of Warcraft' gameplay imagery but misses translating it into a cover design for 'Final Fantasy XIV'.

JudgeID: 1
{
    "score_4o": "2",
    "score_reason": "The MLLM focuses on a contemporary theme of knowledge and opportunity but does not align with the standard answer which emphasizes 'Influence of literature' in historical and artistic terms with an 'illuminated manuscript'. The connection to Image 1 and Image 2 discussed by MLLM seems too broad and not grounded in the specific artistic and literary influence discussed in the standard answer."

{
    "score_4o": "3",
    "score_reason": "The MLLM output identifies a relationship involving the transmission of wisdom from the past to the present, blending spiritual and contemporary elements. However, it doesn't fully embrace the 'Influence of literature' theme as apparent in the standard answer involving historical progression from illuminated manuscripts to graphic novels. MLLM's answer is relatively close in addressing the evolution of ideas through time but lacks precise connection to the original standard's choice."

{
    "score_4o": "2",
    "score_reason": "The MLLM suggests a reinterpretation of Image 2's biblical text with modern elements rather than focusing on a 'medieval scribe,' which reflects a preserved and traditional aspect of literary influence. The connection it tries to make between storytelling styles is somewhat different from the historical link the standard answer emphasizes."

Folder: Changes in social hierarchy (people, history, relation, NA, English)
JudgeID: 0
{
    "score_4o": "1",
    "score_reason": "The MLLM aims at a modern novel cover reflecting teamwork themes which lacks the focus on 'Changes in social hierarchy' as explored in the standard answer. While it identifies a contrast between historical and modern perspectives, it does not effectively establish or demonstrate the specific relation that's central in the standard answer, i.e., from royal court (indicative of historical governance) to government assembly."

JudgeID: 1
{
    "score_4o": "1",
    "score_reason": "The MLLM designed a setting combining business and legislative elements without effectively addressing the underlying 'Changes in social hierarchy' theme in shifting from traditional governance to modern systems. The output misses the historical context of social structures and lacks a direct link to such a transformation within the explanation."

{
    "score_4o": "2",
    "score_reason": "While the MLLM describes differences in leadership depictions and governance contexts, it fails to focus on Image 4 representation being 'modern board meeting with corporate executives' as needed. The relationship or shift from historical governance depicted is loose and the contextual grasp on social hierarchy changes is weak; aim was not effectively captured."

    "score_reason": "The MLLM captures the similarity in authoritative themes between the images and proposes to symbolize this by combining historical dialogue with modern legislative settings. Although imaginative, it does not directly align with the shift in social structures described in the standard answer; however, it has a reasonable understanding yet misses a key historic reflection aspect needed."

Folder: Transformation of leisure activities (people, STEM, relation, NA, English)
JudgeID: 0
{
    "score_4o": "3",
    "score_reason": "MLLM understands the evolution of leisure activities over time, suggesting a transition of a traditional game to a modern setting. Although it captures the general idea of transformation, the specific example of online gaming was missed, emphasizing the technological shift as present in the standard answer. The connection is evident but not complete."

{
    "score_4o": "3",
    "score_reason": "The MLLM discussion captures transitioning to digital realms well but symbolizes this transition by contrasting fantastical immersion rather than spotlighting technology as transformation backbone. It interprets the connection adequately yet does not specify 'traditional board game,' instead drawing on historic-modern crossover broadly."

{
    "score_4o": "3",
    "score_reason": "The MLLM proposes mixing traditional and leisurely elements into strategic thinking, capturing a change in social interactivity concerning traditional and modern settings. The understanding is logical; however, it needs focus on leisure activity evolution via family engagement in VR setting, explicitly highlighting digital transformation."

{
    "score_4o": "2",
    "score_reason": "The MLLM identifies a connection between traditional Spanish dances and performances but proposes an image that does not fit the standard's emphasis on Portuguese cultural elements.

{
    "score_4o": "2",
    "score_reason": "The MLLM links artistic expression by proposing a tilework image, which mirrors the standard answer's focus on cultural artistic traditions. However, it incorrectly links soup representation with tiles instead of transitioning to a culinary example. This approach only partially aligns with the standard's reasoning."

    "score_4o": "2",
    "score_reason": "The MLLM emphasizes integrating culinary elements with artistic themes, which partially aligns with the standard's use of cultural symbols through art, yet it diverges by introducing a culinary focus instead of recognizing a different country's artistic form. Thus, the MLLM maintains a broad cultural link."
