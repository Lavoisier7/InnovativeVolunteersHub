The doors are simple, rectangular shapes with round tops, and there's a light source at the end of the hallway, suggesting an exit or objective.\n   \n   **Image 2**: This image shows two hares in mid-leap, facing each other. They are captured in sharp focus against a blurred natural background. The hares exhibit a dynamic, almost confrontational posture, with one slightly ahead of the other, suggesting motion and competition.\n   \n   **Image 3**: This image features four red dice with white lettering on a green felt surface.
