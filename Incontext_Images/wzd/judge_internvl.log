{

    "score_reason": "The MLLM identified 'freedom & expression' as the relation, which is a valid interpretation, but does not align with the standard answer's 'Cinematic Inspirations'. The proposed Image 4, 'A bird soaring over a colorful city skyline', maintains the freedom theme but diverges significantly from the standard's symbolic imagery of a poetry book. Therefore, it receives a score indicating a broad connection with loose alignment."
