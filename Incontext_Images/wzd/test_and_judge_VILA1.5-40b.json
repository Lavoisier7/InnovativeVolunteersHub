The jail cell represents confinement, while the bird in flight symbolizes freedom. Similarly, the children in **Image 3** are confined to their classroom, but the bird in flight in **Image 4** represents the freedom they aspire to.

The second pair of images connects to the book \"The Pursuit of Happyness\" through the quote \"A long walk to Wall Street,\" which is a reference to the book's plot.

In the second pair, the phrase is associated with the image of a teepee with an American flag, which could symbolize the enduring spirit of Native American culture. The connection between the two pairs is further emphasized by the use of the phrase \"Life is like a box of chocolates\" in the first pair, which could be seen as a metaphor for the unpredictable and diverse experiences that life offers, much like the diverse flavors of a box of chocolates. The image of a box of chocolates in the second pair could be seen as a visual representation of this metaphor, tying the two pairs together.",

Murals are often commissioned for public spaces, such as museums, galleries, or public buildings, and can be used to convey a message, tell a story, or simply add visual interest to a space. Murals are typically created using a variety of techniques, including fresco, trompe l'oeil, and graffiti, and can be made with a wide range of materials, including paint, plaster, and tile.\n\nA painting, on the other hand, is a smaller-scale artwork that is created on a flat surface, such as canvas, paper, or wood. Paintings can be created using a variety of techniques and materials, including oil, acrylic, and watercolor, and can be hung on walls or displayed in frames. Paintings can be created for a variety of purposes, including personal expression, commercial use, or as part of a larger collection or exhibition.\n\nIn summary, the main difference between a mural and a painting is the scale and location of the artwork. Murals are typically larger and are created directly",
