Similarly, Image 3 shows an iceberg, which is a large mass of ice, and Image 4 depicts a melting ice cube, illustrating the transformation of ice from a solid state to liquid due to temperature changes. Both pairs show a transition from a more intense, natural state to a more subdued, altered form.",

This connection is similar to the one between the dandelion and the candle's smoke, where both convey a sense of impermanence and the beauty of transient moments.

In **Image 1**, the candle's flame has been extinguished, leading to the formation of smoke. This represents a change from a state of light and warmth to one of darkness and dispersion. Similarly, in **Image 2**, the dandelion seeds are being dispersed by the wind, transforming the concentrated structure of the dandelion into scattered seeds across the sky. For **Image 4**, we apply the same theme of transformation to **Image 3**. Just as the candle's flame transforms into smoke and the dandelion seeds disperse, the sandcastle in **Image 3** could transform by having smoke rising from it, indicating a change or destruction, set against a black background to mirror the setting of **Image 1**.

The sandcastle, while impressive, is temporary and will eventually be washed away by the waves. Similarly, the soap bubble, though visually captivating, is fragile and short-lived, destined to burst soon after it forms.\n\nCreating **Image 4** to mirror this relationship with **Image 3**, we should focus on an object or scene that also embodies the concept of fleeting existence. A suitable choice could be:\n\n- **Image 4**: A delicate flower beginning to wilt, capturing the moment just before it loses its vibrant color and starts to decay.\n\n- **Relation**: Transience\n- **Explanation**: Just as the sandcastle and soap bubble represent temporary creations that are beautiful yet short-lived, the candle and wilting flower share a similar theme of transience.

For Image 4, we look at Image 3, which deals with the transformation of light through the atmosphere. To mirror the relationship, Image 4 should depict a transformation related to sand. Sedimentation is a natural process where sand and other particles settle out of a suspension, changing the form and location of the sand, similar to how sand changes state and location when it moves through an hourglass.",

The metronome in Image 3 is related to maintaining tempo in music, which is crucial for the proper performance of the notated music shown in Images 1 and 2. To mirror the relationship between Image 1 and Image 2, Image 4 should depict an element involved in the practical application of music notation and timing, such as a conductor's baton, which directs the ensemble performing the music.",

Applying this to Image 3, which is a birthday cake explicitly meant for a celebratory event, Image 4 should depict something related to celebration as well.

Image 1 shows the negative consequence of consuming unhealthy food (the burger), while Image 2 presents a healthier option (fresh green onions).

To mirror this relationship, **Image 4** should represent a form of value that complements **Image 3**.
