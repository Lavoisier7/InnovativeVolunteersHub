This theme of time and transformation is mirrored in the relationship between Image 3 and the conceptual Image 4. The hourglass in Image 3 symbolizes the passage of time, while the planet inside represents a whole entity. In the imagined Image 4, this concept is extended to show the planet breaking apart and falling through the hourglass, symbolizing how even seemingly permanent things can change and disintegrate over cosmic timescales.

The connection between these images suggests urban development and the passage of time. To mirror this relationship, Image 4 should depict a cityscape from 2014, advancing three years from Image 3's 2011, just as Image 2 showed a scene from the year in Image 1. This progression highlights both technological advancement (from diamond-encrusted numbers to digital globes) and urban growth over time, connecting the concepts of yearly milestones with tangible changes in cityscapes.",

The snowy forest landscape provides a vast, open space, while the bird in flight embodies unrestricted movement through its habitat. Applying this relationship to Image 3, we can imagine Image 4 as an elephant in water, perhaps swimming or spraying water with its trunk. This would mirror the freedom of movement seen in the bird, but in the elephant's natural aquatic environment, just as the forest is natural for many birds.

Both symbolize the marking and passage of time in different ways - one personal and intimate, the other grand and public. Extending this relationship to Image 3 and the conceptual Image 4, we see the ritual of pouring wine (Image 3) paired with the act of winding or setting a personal timepiece (Image 4).

Pirates have long been a threat in these waters, as symbolized by the classic pirate ship. Somalia's coastline, shown in the map, has been a hotspot for modern piracy in recent years. \n\nApplying this concept to Image 3 (passenger plane) and the proposed Image 4 (airport with security), we see a parallel between maritime and aviation security threats.

The desert sand in Image 1 is shaped by time and environmental forces, creating patterns that reflect the passage of time on a grand scale. Image 2 directly uses sand to measure short periods of time in a controlled manner. \n\nExtending this concept to Images 3 and 4, we see methods of measuring or representing space and time visually.

The relationship between these images is characterized by the concept of recurring patterns and balanced states. Applying this relationship to Image 3 (stock market data) and the proposed Image 4 (economic cycle diagram), we see a similar pattern. The stock market data represents fluctuations in financial systems, which often follow cyclical patterns of growth and decline, just as the economy goes through cycles of expansion and contraction.

The lunar phases diagram shows the repetitive cycle of the moon's appearance as seen from Earth, while the pendulum diagram illustrates the back-and-forth swinging motion of a pendulum. Both depict regular, predictable patterns that repeat over time.\n\nExtending this relationship to Images 3 and 4, the sine wave graph in Image 3 also represents a cyclical pattern, showing the repetitive oscillation of the sine function. To mirror this relationship, Image 4 could be conceptualized as a circular motion diagram, which would depict another form of cyclical movement. This could show an object moving in a circular path, emphasizing the continuous, repetitive nature of the motion, similar to how the sine wave repeats its pattern.\n\nAll four images thus share the common theme of representing cyclical patterns, whether in celestial movements, mechanical oscillations, mathematical functions, or conceptual circular motion.

To mirror this relationship, Image 4 (nostrils) provides a close-up, detailed view of a specific body part, contrasting with Image 3's full-body view of a cow in its environment.

The blank paper represents a space waiting to be filled, just as the people icon suggests individuals who could provide or receive information. Applying this concept to Image 3 (coins), we can infer that Image 4 should be an empty wallet or purse. Like the blank paper, an empty wallet represents potential - in this case, financial potential. The coins in Image 3, like the people in Image 1, represent the content or value that could fill that potential space.

Following this pattern, Image 3 displays a modern architectural element (glass roof), so Image 4 is conceived as its traditional counterpart - a thatched roof.

The game designers have likely used references of real-world textures and objects (like the wooden bench) to create authentic-looking details in their virtual world. Applying this same principle to Image 3 and the created Image 4, we see that the clay tile roof in Image 3 could serve as a reference for creating realistic roofing textures in a medieval-themed 3D environment, which is represented in the described Image 4.
