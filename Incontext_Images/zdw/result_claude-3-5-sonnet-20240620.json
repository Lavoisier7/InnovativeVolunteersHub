The monkey appears to be a juvenile, while the oak tree is fully grown and sprawling, suggesting the passage of time and maturation. Applying this same concept to Image 3 (nails in wood), we can imagine Image 4 as a young tree or sapling, representing the early stages of growth that will eventually lead to a mature tree like the one in Image 2. This parallel emphasizes the universal nature of growth and development across different aspects of the natural world, from animals to plants to human-made structures.",

The oak tree represents a typical environment where a monkey might live, providing shelter and a place for the monkey to climb and sit. To mirror this relationship, Image 4 (banana on a tree branch) is proposed as a complement to Image 3 (hammer). Just as the tree is a natural element for the monkey, the banana is a natural \"tool\" for primates, often associated with their diet and foraging behavior. The hammer, being a man-made tool, contrasts with the natural banana, yet both serve as instruments used by their respective users (humans and monkeys) to interact with their environments. This pairing highlights the contrast between natural and artificial tools while maintaining the theme of habitat and utility.",

The hammer is designed to drive nails into wood or remove them. To mirror this relationship, Image 4 would be a banana, which is a primary food source for many monkey species. Just as the hammer is designed to interact with nails, a monkey's hands and digestive system are adapted to peel and eat bananas. This maintains the \"tool and target\" relationship, where the monkey's physical adaptations are the \"tool\" and the banana is the \"target\" or intended object of interaction.",

The hammer is designed to drive nails into wood, which is exactly what we see in Image 2. To mirror this relationship with Image 3 (oak tree), I've proposed Image 4 as a woodpecker pecking at the tree trunk. Here, the woodpecker serves as a natural \"tool\" whose beak is adapted for pecking into tree bark, making the oak tree its target. This maintains the tool-target relationship while transitioning from man-made objects to elements found in nature."

In Image 1, we see sushi rolls where rice and fillings are wrapped in nori (seaweed), presenting a composed dish. Image 2 shows chickpeas that have been transformed through roasting, changing their texture and flavor profile. \n\nApplying this concept to Image 3 and the proposed Image 4, we see a similar transformation. Image 3 presents a chirashi sushi bowl, where sushi ingredients (rice, seafood, vegetables) are deconstructed and arranged in a bowl. The proposed Image 4, a traditional nigiri sushi platter, would show these same ingredients transformed into individual pieces of sushi, with fish or seafood placed atop small mounds of rice. This mirrors the relationship between the composed sushi rolls and the transformed chickpeas by showing how the same core ingredients can be presented in different forms within Japanese cuisine.",

The ceramic bowl (Image 1) could be used for drinking matcha or other teas, while the bamboo whisk (Image 2) is specifically used for preparing matcha by whisking the powdered green tea into a froth. \n\nExtending this relationship to Image 3 and the proposed Image 4, we see that Image 3 depicts the act of preparing tea, showing hot water being poured over tea leaves. To complete the set, Image 4 would logically be a tea caddy or container for storing the loose tea leaves used in the ceremony. This maintains the theme of tea ceremony implements and preparation, with each pair (1-2 and 3-4) representing different aspects of the tea-making process: serving/preparing and brewing/storing, respectively.",

The makeup vanity is a place where people prepare their appearance, often dividing their face into areas for different cosmetic applications. Similarly, the restroom entrance divides people into separate spaces based on gender, where they may also prepare their appearance.\n\nTo mirror this relationship, Image 4 (sliced bread) would relate to Image 3 (whole loaf) in a similar way. The whole loaf represents the unaltered state, like an unprepared face or undivided group. The sliced bread shows the preparation for consumption and the division into individual portions, much like how makeup divides and prepares the face, or how restrooms divide people into separate spaces.",

Both evoke feelings of coziness and homeyness. The soft, layered textures of the bedding mirror the pillowy softness of the bread. To mirror this relationship, Image 4 (imagined bread slice) relates to Image 3 (restroom signs) by representing duality and clear separation, much like the distinct male and female sides of the restroom entrance. The bread slice with two different spreads embodies this concept of division and clear categorization, while still maintaining the comforting, familiar nature of bread established in the first pair.",

Bread is a staple food that provides warmth and sustenance, while the bedroom is decorated in a soft, inviting style that promotes relaxation and coziness. Both evoke feelings of comfort and being at ease.\n\nApplying this relationship to Image 3 (vanity setup) and the proposed Image 4 (cookies), we see a similar theme of comfort and indulgence, but in a more luxurious context. The vanity represents a space for self-care and pampering, while cookies are a sweet treat that people often enjoy for comfort or pleasure. Both the vanity and cookies provide a sense of indulgence and self-nurturing, mirroring the comfort provided by bread and a cozy bedroom, but with an added element of luxury or special occasion."

The blank paper represents a space waiting to be filled, just as the people icon suggests individuals who could provide or receive information. Applying this concept to Image 3 (coins), we can infer that Image 4 should be an empty wallet or purse. Like the blank paper, an empty wallet represents potential - in this case, financial potential. The coins in Image 3, like the people in Image 1, represent the content or value that could fill that potential space. This parallel maintains the theme of \"container and content\" across both pairs, with the container (paper/wallet) ready to be filled by the corresponding elements (people's ideas/coins).",

Image 1 shows a simple phrase in Chinese characters, representing a minimal, concise expression. In contrast, Image 2 displays a pile of many coins, symbolizing abundance and multiplicity. To mirror this relationship, Image 4 should depict a single coin on the sandy ground, creating a minimal counterpart to the blank paper in Image 3. This maintains the theme of progression from a singular, minimal element (one phrase, one coin) to a more expansive or open-ended concept (many coins, blank paper full of potential).",

Coins are units of currency, while Chinese characters are units of language. Each coin has value within the monetary system, just as each character has meaning within the language system. Applying this logic to Image 3 (people icon), we can create Image 4 as an icon representing multiple currency units, mirroring how Image 3 shows multiple people as units within a social or organizational system.
