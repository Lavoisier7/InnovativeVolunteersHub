    "score_4o": "0",
    "score_reason": "The MLLM's response does not relate to the standard answer's theme of 'Spanish expressions for being stunned or shocked'. Instead, it focuses on a different, incorrect theme of 'historical or cultural significance' without connecting to the idea of a shocked or stunned expression. The explanation also fails to align with the standard logic of expressions signifying shock or surprise."

{
    "score_4o": "0",
    "score_reason": "The MLLM presented a 'flight' theme, unrelated to the Spanish expression theme that involves being absent-minded or dreamy. The explanation provided does not correspond to the specific whimsical or scatterbrained nature of the standard answer. The MLLM's response fails to engage with the meaningful connection demonstrated in the standard explanation."

    "score_4o": "1",
    "score_reason": "The MLLM's response begins to explore 'imagination and reality', but it remains too broad and does not adequately relate to the specific theme of the Spanish expression for being dreamy or scatterbrained. The explanation lacks the emphasis on whimsical or scatterbrained states and does not connect seamlessly with the intended imaginative or dreamy visual symbolism of the standard answer."

This misses the whimsical or scatterbrained aesthetic that the standard answer highlights. The disconnection between the MLLM's logic and the culturally tied expressions results in a score of 0 for irrelevance and inability to align with the intended reason."

The response misses the specific cultural context and logic required by the standard explanation, leaving it unrelated to the Spanish slang 'Tener pájaros en la cabeza.'"
