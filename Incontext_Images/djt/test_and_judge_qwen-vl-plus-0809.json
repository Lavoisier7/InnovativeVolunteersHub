Image 2 displays the raw material for pickling, the cucumbers. Image 3 explains the biological process of osmosis, which is not directly related to pickling but can be seen as a form of transformation where water moves across a membrane. Image 4 represents another type of transformation, this time being the conversion of sugar into alcohol during fermentation. The common theme here is the transformation of one state or substance into another, whether it's food preservation, cellular processes, or chemical reactions.",

Image 3, while not directly related to biology, shows diversity in the form of whole and sliced cucumbers, which can be seen as a metaphor for the variety of forms life can take. Image 4 would similarly show the diversity in cellular structures by contrasting plant and animal cells, mirroring the theme of biological diversity present in Images 1 and 2.",

Image 1 shows osmosis, which is a fundamental process in cellular biology, while Image 2 compares two types of cells, prokaryotic and eukaryotic, which are the building blocks of life. Image 3, featuring pickled vegetables, relates to Image 4 by being part of the broader biological process of food preservation, where fermentation can be seen as a form of metabolic activity similar to the energy production shown in Image 4. Therefore, Image 4 could be designed to show the process of fermentation, linking it back to the theme of biological processes and the transformation of substances",
