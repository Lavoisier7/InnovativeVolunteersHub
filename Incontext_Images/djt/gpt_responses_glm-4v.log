In Image 1, we have 4 + 7 = 11; in Image 2, 7 + 2 = 9. In Image 3, the first equation is 2 + 2 = 4, which corresponds to the second equation in Image 1, and the second equation in Image 3 is 6 + 1 = 7, corresponding to the second equation in Image 2.

The scene suggests a work environment with natural light coming through a window in the background.\n- **Image 2**: A close-up view of a hand holding a pen above a notebook page, ready to write. The setting appears to be indoors, possibly at home or an office, illuminated by ambient lighting.\n- **Image 3**: A digital tablet screen displaying a graphic user interface with various icons arranged neatly in rows and columns. The interface suggests a modern app or software with a clean and minimalist design.\n- **Image 4**: A photograph of a typewriter with visible keys and a sheet of paper inserted into it. The image evokes a vintage feel, reminiscent of traditional writing methods before the prevalence of digital technology.\n- **Relation**: \"Transition from Traditional to Digital\"\n- **Explanation**: Both Image 1 and Image 2 depict human actions related to writing—one using modern digital tools, the other traditional analog means. Image 3 represents the pinnacle of digital interaction with technology. Image 4 bridges the gap by showing the precursor to digital writing instruments. Together, they narrate a chronological shift from manual, analog processes to digital ones.",

In Image 1, the clean lines and uncluttered presentation of the perfume bottle alongside the natural daisy convey a sense of purity and straightforwardness. Image 4 extends this idea further by using abstract forms and restrained color choices to represent complexity through simplicity, much like how Image 2 uses simple elements to evoke tranquility.",

It has a red collar adorned with golden patterns and a bell, and there are smaller Maneki Neko figures surrounding it.\n- **Image 2**: A close-up of a single Maneki Neko figurine's face, showing detailed features such as the eyes, nose, and whiskers, conveying a sense of warmth and friendliness.\n- **Image 3**: A group of Maneki Neko figurines arranged in a tiered formation, each one slightly smaller than the last, creating an ascending depth effect. They all have similar facial expressions and are facing forward.\n- **Image 4**: A collection of Maneki Neko figurines displayed in a descending order of size, mirroring the arrangement of **Image 3** but with each figure facing towards the center, as if they are all looking at **Image 1**.\n- **Relation**: Themes of growth and descent; the progression from larger to smaller figures in **Image 1** is echoed in the arrangement of **Image 4**, maintaining the central focus while altering the perspective.\n- **Explanation**: Both images feature Maneki Neko figurines, which symbolize good luck and fortune.
