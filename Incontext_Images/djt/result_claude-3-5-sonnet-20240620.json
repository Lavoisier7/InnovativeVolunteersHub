The flat strip becomes a twisted, continuous surface with no clear beginning or end. Applying this concept to Image 3 and the created Image 4, we transform the linear snake into a snake-like Möbius strip. This maintains the serpentine qualities and scaly texture of the snake, but reshapes it into an endless loop, mirroring the conceptual leap from the flat strip to the Möbius strip in the first pair."

To mirror this relationship, Image 4 conceptualizes an owl in flight, connecting to Image 3's use of owls as symbolic creatures. This maintains the theme of wisdom (associated with owls) and the transition from a static, symbolic representation to a dynamic, realistic depiction. Both pairs move from conceptual art to a more lifelike representation, while preserving their respective themes of peace and wisdom.",

The white dove in flight is a widely recognized symbol of peace, which is then stylized and incorporated into the peace symbol sketch along with olive branches, another peace symbol. Following this pattern, Image 4 should be a symbolic representation related to the owl in Image 3. Owls are often associated with wisdom and knowledge, so a sketch incorporating owls with books or other symbols of learning would mirror the relationship between the first pair of images.

Monkeys, as primates, represent an earlier stage in evolution, while the moon symbolizes a distant, seemingly unreachable goal that humans have aspired to and eventually reached. This theme of progression and aspiration is mirrored in the relationship between Image 3 (person on ladder) and the proposed Image 4 (rocket launch). The person climbing a ladder represents human ambition and the initial steps towards reaching higher, while a rocket launch symbolizes the ultimate realization of that ambition - venturing into space. Both pairs illustrate the concept of advancement, from earthbound to sky-bound, emphasizing humanity's continuous drive to explore and achieve new heights.",

Monkeys are not typically associated with the moon, creating a sense of something being out of its natural habitat. Applying this concept to Image 3 (robots in desert), we can create Image 4 with a similar unexpected placement. Just as robots don't belong in a desert, a fish on an iceberg in the ocean creates a parallel sense of displacement.

The tortoise is known for its plodding pace, while rabbits are associated with speed and agility. Applying this concept to Image 3 (busy city traffic) and the proposed Image 4 (birds in flight), we maintain the contrast between slow and fast movement in an urban context. The gridlocked traffic represents the slow, tortoise-like progress, while the birds soaring freely above the city embody the swift, unhindered movement of the rabbit, creating a parallel contrast in speed within a different environment.",
