The soccer ball is in the foreground, with the panda's face and body behind it, looking as if it were pushing the ball forward. The soccer ball would have the Premier League logo on it, and it's likely to be white, red, and black.\n- **Relation**: Symbolism\n- **Explanation**: Both pairs of images represent a connection between a symbol of a sport (soccer ball/lion) and an animal that could be associated with the sport (the panda/the logo). This is achieved by having the symbol directly interact with the animal. In the first pair, the lion is holding the ball, and in the second pair, the panda is obscured by the ball. The second image is designed to mirror the first, with the panda acting as the object being used to display the symbol.",

Image 4 replicates this theme, incorporating the natural setting of the lion into the image of the bullfight, further highlighting this conflict between raw power and human manipulation. This is achieved by including the tall grass and blue sky, reminiscent of the lion's environment, in the bullfighting scene. \n",
