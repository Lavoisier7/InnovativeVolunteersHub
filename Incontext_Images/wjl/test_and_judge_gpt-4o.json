The relationship is about focusing on a centerpiece that captures attention either by its scale or detail. For Image 3 and Image 4, the emphasis should be on a striking feature within a scene.

Similarly, the second pair can relate the map of Australia to the kangaroo, another representative symbol of the country. Both pairs illustrate how specific animals are culturally associated with the nations depicted in the maps.",

For Image 3, the elephants represent wildlife in Kenya. Therefore, Image 4, a map of Kenya, mirrors Image 3, pairing the wildlife in each country with its geographic depiction.",

Similarly, the creation of an image reflecting Côte d'Ivoire's wildlife (e.g. an elephant) parallels the relationship as both figures are representations of the respective nation's natural characteristic and heritage.",
