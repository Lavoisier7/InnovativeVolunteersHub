The pens appear to be of the same brand or series, given their uniform design, and are positioned in a way that highlights their colors and tips.\nSecond image: The second image is a chart titled \"MOST BASIC KANJI CHARACTERS,\" which lists various Japanese Kanji characters along with their meanings and readings. The chart is organized in a grid format, making it easy to read and understand the associations between the characters and their meanings.\nRelation: The relation between the two images can be described as \"study materials.\" The pens in the first image can be associated with the act of studying or writing, while the Kanji chart in the second image is directly related to learning and understanding the Japanese language. Both images can be connected through the theme of education and learning.\nExplanation: The pens in the first image symbolize the tools used for writing and studying, while the Kanji chart in the second image represents the knowledge and language skills being learned.
