The storm cloud represents challenges and the unknown, while the sailboat under the starry sky suggests peace and a connection to something larger than oneself. The Buddha and the line of figures symbolize spiritual practice and enlightenment, and the angel flying above the clouds embodies a sense of divine presence and the possibility of rising above earthly concerns. \n"
