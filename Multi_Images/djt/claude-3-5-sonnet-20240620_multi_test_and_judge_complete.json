Owls are known natural predators of small rodents like mice. While the glass owl is an artistic, inanimate object, its sleek form still evokes the silent, watchful nature of a real owl. The mouse, captured in a lifelike pose, seems alert and vulnerable, mirroring the natural wariness small rodents have towards owl predators in the wild. This pairing subtly alludes to the predator-prey relationship in nature, even though one subject is an art piece and the other a living creature.",
