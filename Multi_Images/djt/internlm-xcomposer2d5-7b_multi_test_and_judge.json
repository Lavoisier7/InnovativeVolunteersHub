The ships are arranged in rows, and there is text in a different language at the top and bottom of the image.\n- Relation: Connection\n- Explanation: The connection between the two images lies in their historical significance. The first image represents a modern football club with a long history dating back to 1899. The second image, with its depiction of ships, may represent a historical event or period, possibly related to exploration, trade, or naval warfare. Both images evoke a sense of history and legacy, though they belong to vastly different contexts and time periods.",
