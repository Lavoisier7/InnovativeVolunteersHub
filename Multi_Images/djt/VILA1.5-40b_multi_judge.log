    "score_reason": "The MLLM's output is roughly correct and mentions key facts such as the Eiffel Tower being in Paris and the Statue of Liberty being in New York City, which aligns with the standard answer. However, it does not explicitly mention the connection to 'Urban Landmarks,' instead focusing on the individual significance of the landmarks. This lack of emphasis on the urban aspect makes the explanation incomplete."

    "score_reason": "The MLLM's output identifies both the Eiffel Tower and the Statue of Liberty as monuments, which aligns with part of the standard answer's theme of cultural and tourism icons. However, it provides a broader and less specific relationship as 'Monuments' instead of 'Urban Landmarks' as stated in the standard answer. The explanation focuses on each being a significant landmark but lacks the depth of symbolic meaning related to urban culture and tourism described in the standard answer."
