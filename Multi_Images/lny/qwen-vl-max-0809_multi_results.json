        "- First image: Volcanic eruption with a mushroom-shaped cloud.\n- Second image: Diagram of a nuclear chain reaction.\n- Relation: Explosive processes.\n- Explanation: Both images depict explosive processes. The first image shows a volcanic eruption, which is a natural explosion caused by the release of magma, gases, and ash from the Earth's crust. The second image illustrates a nuclear chain reaction, a process in which neutrons are released during nuclear fission, leading to a rapid and self-sustaining sequence of reactions that can result in an explosion, such as in a nuclear bomb. Both phenomena involve the release of significant energy in a short period.",
