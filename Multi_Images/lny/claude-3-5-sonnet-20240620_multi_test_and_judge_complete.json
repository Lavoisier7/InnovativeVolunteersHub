The corn kernels represent a basic, natural form of food, while the 3D glasses are a technological tool designed to enhance visual experiences. Just as the 3D glasses transform a flat image into a seemingly three-dimensional view, corn kernels can be transformed through various processes (like popping or milling) to create different food experiences.
