The volcanic eruption's mushroom cloud expands rapidly outward, similar to how a chain reaction results in an increasingly rapid multiplication of events. Each new generation in the chain reaction, like the expanding cloud, leads to even more events in the next generation, showcasing the powerful effect of compounding growth. \n"

In nuclear fission, a neutron strikes an unstable nucleus, causing it to split and release more neutrons, which in turn strike other nuclei, leading to an exponential release of energy. This chain reaction is what fuels the immense power of nuclear weapons and nuclear power plants. \n"
