It is kept in the museum's Salle des États room, and its popularity often leads to crowds forming to view the painting. The glass pyramid in the courtyard of the Louvre Museum, designed by architect I. M. Pei, was constructed in 1989 and serves as a modernist contrast to the museum's historical architecture. This pyramid also marks the entrance to the underground Louvre Carrousel.

The addition of the domed cloud in the second image introduces an element of distortion and further emphasizes the chaotic and destructive nature of nuclear explosions. The small circles scattered throughout the images might represent the countless different ways in which the explosion impacts its surroundings and affects those in its vicinity.",
