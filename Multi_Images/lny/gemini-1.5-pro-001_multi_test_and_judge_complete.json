            "MLLM_answer": "- First image: Nuclear explosion mushroom cloud.\n- Second image: Diagram of a chain reaction.\n- Relation: **Nuclear fission**\n- Explanation: The first image depicts the devastating result of a nuclear explosion, while the second image illustrates the principle behind such an event: a nuclear chain reaction. In nuclear fission, a neutron strikes an unstable nucleus, causing it to split and release more neutrons, which in turn strike other nuclei, leading to an exponential release of energy. This chain reaction is what fuels the immense power of nuclear weapons and nuclear power plants. \n",

The second image illustrates a chain reaction, the process underlying nuclear fission, where a neutron strikes a nucleus, causing it to split and release more neutrons that trigger further splits in a cascading effect. \n",

This exponential growth in energy release is what ultimately leads to the massive explosion depicted in the second image, a devastating consequence of uncontrolled nuclear fission. \n",
