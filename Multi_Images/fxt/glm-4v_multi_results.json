        "- First image: A diagram illustrating a lever with four parts labeled as follows: The first part is connected to the fulcrum and represents the force arm; the second part is opposite the fulcrum and represents resistance; the third part is connected to the force arm and indicates effort; and the fourth part is opposite the force arm and represents the resistance arm.\n\n- Second image: A simplified representation of a seesaw with two ends labeled as follows: One end is shorter and marked as \"EFFORT,\" while the other end is longer and marked as \"RESISTANCE.\"\n\n- Relation: Both images depict a mechanical advantage scenario where one end of an object is used to apply force to another end, effectively multiplying the force applied at one end by the length of the lever/seesaw in the opposite direction.\n\n- Explanation: The first image shows a classic lever setup where the effort is concentrated on one side of the fulcrum, amplifying the force applied to the opposite side, which faces resistance. Similarly, the second image portrays a seesaw where the shorter end, representing effort, is placed closer to the pivot point (the fulcrum), making it easier to lift the heavier end (representing resistance). Both images illustrate the principle of leverage in physics, which allows for the multiplication of force over distance.",
        "- First image: A diagram illustrating a lever with four parts labeled: 1st Part (Fulcrum), 2nd Part (Resistance), 3rd Part (Effort), and 4th Part (Force Arm). The fulcrum is shown at the base of the lever, while the resistance and force arms extend from opposite sides of the lever.\n\n- Second image: A simplified representation of a seesaw with two ends labeled: one end as the 'load' and the other end as the 'effort'. The load side is longer than the effort side, indicating an imbalance in weight distribution.\n\n- Relation: Both images depict tools that aid in lifting or moving objects with less manual effort through the application of leverage.\n\n- Explanation: The first image represents a classic lever mechanism where the fulcrum is the point of pivot, allowing the force applied at one end (Effort) to multiply its effect on the other end (Resistance). The second image portrays a similar principle in a seesaw context, where the shorter end requires more effort to balance the longer end holding the load. Both images convey the fundamental physics principle of using leverage to redistribute effort for mechanical advantage.",
        "- First image: A seesaw with an orange arrow labeled \"Effort\" pointing towards one end and a heavy load on the other, supported by a blue fulcrum in the middle.\n- Second image: A balanced scale with weights on either side, indicating equilibrium.\n- Relation: Balance\n- Explanation: Both images depict a situation of balance where the effort applied is equal to the load, resulting in stability. The seesaw shows this directly with equal lengths on both sides, while the balance scale represents the same concept metaphorically with the weights balanced on opposite ends.",

The seesaw shows this directly through its physical balance, while the scale represents the conceptual idea of balancing forces.",
        "- First image: A seesaw with an orange arrow labeled \"Effort\" pointing towards one end and a heavy load on the other, supported by a blue fulcrum in the middle.\n- Second image: A balanced scale with weights on either side, indicating equilibrium.\n- Relation: Balance\n- Explanation: Both images depict a situation of balance where the effort applied is equal to the load being lifted, achieved through the placement of the fulcrum at the midpoint of the beam or scale. This central support ensures that the forces on either side are equal, resulting in stability.",

This juxtaposition highlights the versatility of the hand and the variability of the nutcracker's use.",
