In finance, leverage refers to the use of borrowed funds to increase the potential return of an investment. Just as a lever amplifies force, financial leverage can amplify returns on investments.

The second image presents Newton's second law of motion, which describes the relationship between an object's mass, its acceleration, and the applied force. This law is a key principle in understanding how objects move under the influence of forces, including gravity. Therefore, the connection between the two images lies in the physics principle of gravity and motion.",
