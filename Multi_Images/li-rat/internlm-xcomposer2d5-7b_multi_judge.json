The standard answer connects both images through a resemblance in shape and function rather than contrasting them. The MLLM does not mention the resemblance between the fan's blades and the peacock's tail feathers, which is a key aspect of the standard answer."

However, it correctly identifies the peacock's symbolism and the function of the anesthesia machine, which are relevant observations, albeit not aligned with the provided explanation."
