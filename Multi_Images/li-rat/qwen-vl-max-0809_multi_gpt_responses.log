The second image shows a drum set, an instrument used in music for creating rhythms and beats. The connection here lies in the creative expression; just as a pen is used to express thoughts and ideas through writing, a drum set is used to express emotions and creativity through music. Both are tools for artistic expression in different mediums.",
