Is the top digit greater than or equal to the bottom digit?\n    * **YES:**  Proceed directly to subtracting the ones digits.\n    * **NO:**  Regrouping is needed.\n4. **Trade a Ten for Ten Ones:** Borrow a 'ten' from the tens place of the top number, breaking it down into ten 'ones.'\n5. **Add 10 to the Top One:** Add these ten 'ones' to the ones digit of the top number.\n6. **Subtract the Ones:** Now subtract the ones digits.\n7. **Subtract the Tens:** Subtract the tens digits.\n8. **Done!:** The subtraction problem is complete. \n"
