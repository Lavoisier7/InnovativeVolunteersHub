This parallel highlights the concept of void or lack in both a physical and symbolic context, demonstrating how absence can be represented in both tangible and abstract forms.",

In contrast, the person at the fence suggests a more restrictive form of confinement, with the chain-link fence acting as a barrier or boundary.
