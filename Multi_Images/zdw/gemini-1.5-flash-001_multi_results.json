In the case of the magnetic field lines, they approach infinity at the poles of the magnet but never actually touch them. Similarly, the graph of y = 1/x approaches infinity as x approaches zero, but never intersects the y-axis.

The second image shows the graph of a rational function, which also exhibits inverse proportionality. As the input value approaches zero, the output value increases without bound. This is similar to the magnetic field lines near the poles of a bar magnet, which become increasingly dense as they get closer to the poles.  \n",
