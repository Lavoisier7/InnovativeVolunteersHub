The second image explains how heart rate variability (HRV) can indicate stress levels, with low HRV associated with a \"fight or flight\" state and poor recovery, and high HRV associated with a relaxed state and increased recovery.

The second image features a spiral staircase, which is a man-made structure that mimics the spiral pattern found in nature, such as the one seen in the sunflower. This connection highlights how natural patterns can inspire architectural and design elements in human creations.",
