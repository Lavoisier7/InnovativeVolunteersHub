        "- First image: A graphical representation of a normal distribution curve labeled as \"3 Sigma curve,\" which typically indicates a bell-shaped curve that encloses 99.7% of the data within one standard deviation above and below the mean.\n  \n- Second image: Another graphical representation of a normal distribution curve labeled as \"6 Sigma curve,\" which is similar to the first but represents a tighter confidence interval with only 99.99% of the data within two standard deviations from the mean.\n  \n- Relation: Both images depict different levels of confidence in statistical distributions, with the second image showing a more stringent confidence level compared to the first.\n  \n- Explanation: The term 'Sigma' refers to standard deviation, a measure of the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of values. In Six Sigma methodology, which is used for process improvement, the goal is to produce processes that operate at near-perfect quality levels, indicated by a 6 Sigma curve. This means that only 0.0034% of the data lies beyond the USL (Upper Specification Limit) and LSL (Lower Specification Limit), indicating very high precision and quality control.",
