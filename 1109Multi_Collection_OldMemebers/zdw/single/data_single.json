In East Asian religious art, such depictions often utilize the visual effect of light beams to symbolize divinity and enlightenment. This artistic representation evokes the Tyndall Effect, where the light appears to radiate outwards, creating an ethereal atmosphere. While the light itself might be artificial, the visual effect mimics the Tyndall Effect, connecting it to the natural phenomenon depicted in the first image.
